WHAT AEE THEY?

HE repast finished, the Holy Brethren,
rising; from the table together, forsook
the Refectory. Some disappeared
into cloisters on the sides of the great
hallway, others strolled out in front, and

seating themselves on benches that were
3—1

about, commenced rolling and smoking
cigarettes.

The Abbot excusing himself to his stranger
guests, on plea of pressing business, was
invisible for a time. So they were permitted
to betake themselves apart. Good manners
secured them this. The others naturally supposed
they might want a word in private, sono
one offered to intrude upon them.

Just what they did want, and had been
anxiously longing for. They had mutually
to communicate ; questions to be asked, and
counsel taken together. Each was burning to
know what the other thought of the company
they had fallen into ; the character of which
was alike perplexing to both.

After getting hold of their hats they sauntered
out by the great door, through which
they had entered on the night before. The
sun was now at meridian height, and his beams

fell clown upon the patch of open ground in
front of the monastery ; for a monastery they
supposed it must be. A glance backward as
they walked out from its walls showed its
architecture purely of the conventual style ;
windows with pointed arches, the larger ones
heavy mullions, and a campanile upon the
roof. This however, without bells, and partially
broken down ; as was much of the outer
mason work everywhere. Here and there
were walls crumbling to decay, others half
hidden under masses of creeping plants and
cryptogamia, in short the whole structure
seemed more or less dilapidated.

Soon they entered under the shadow of the
trees ; long-leaved evergreen pines loaded
with parasites and epiphytes, among these
several species of orchids — rare phenomenon
in the vegetable world, that would have
delighted the eye of a botanist. As they

wished to get beyond earshot of those left
lounging by the porch, they continued on along
a walk which had once been gravelled, but was
now overgrown with weeds and grass. It
formed a cool arcade, the thick foliage meeting
over-head, and screening it from the rays of
the sun. Following it for about a hundred
yards or so, they again had the clear sky
before them, and saw they were on the brow
of a steep slope — almost a precipice — which,
after trending a short distance right and left,
took a turn back toward the mass of the
mountain. It was the boundary of the platform
on which the building stood with a still
higher cliff behind.

The point they had arrived sat was a prominent
one, affording view of the whole
valley of Mexico, that lay spread out like
a picture at their feet. And such a picture !
Nothing in all the panoramic world to excel
if equal it.

But as scenery was not in their thoughts they
gave it but a glance, sitting down with faces
turned towards one another. For there were
seats here also — several rustic chairs under
shady trees — it being evidently a favourite
loitering place of the friars.

'' Well, Oris, old comrade," said Kearney
first to speak, " we've gone through a good
deal this day or two in the way of change.
What do you think of these new acquaintances
of ours ? "

Thar, Cap., ye put a puzzler."

Are they monks ? "

Wal ; them is a sort o' animals I saint
had much dealing's wi' ; never seed any till we
kim inter Mexico, 'ceptin' one or two as still
hangs round San Atone in Texas. But this
chile knows little u' thar ways, only from
what he's leering ; an' judging be that he'd
say thar ain't merry monk among 'em."

What then ? Robbers ? '"

"Thar, again, Cap., I'm clean confiscated.
From what we war told o' Mr. Eeeviis in the
gaol, they brighter be that. They saved he
war a captain o' salvador, which means
highwayman. An' yet it do 'pear serous
should be such."

*' From what I know of him," rejoined
Kearney, " what I learned yesterday, it would
be curious indeed — remarkably so. I've reason
to believe him a gentleman born, and that
his title of captain comes from his having
been an officer in the army."

*' That mount be an' still wouldn't contrary
his having' turned to t'other. Down by the
the Eio Grande, thar are scores o' Mexican
officers, who've did the same, from lieutenants,
up to kernels — aye girls. Thar's Canales,
who commanded the whole cavalry brigade —
the " Chapel fox " as we Texans call him —

an' thar ain't a fuss thief or cut-throat from
Matamoras up to the mountains. An what
air ole Santy himself but a robber o' the
meanest an' most dastardly sort ? So, taint
any sign o' honesty their bearing military
titles. When they've a war on in thai
revolutionary way, they turn rogers, atween
times takin' to the road."

Well, Oris, supposing these to be on the
road now, what ought we to do, think
you ? "

Needy use thinking', Cap. ; since thar's
no choice left us. Taint die dog, or feet
the hatchet ; and this chile goes for chain
the steel. Whatever they be, we're bound
to stick to 'em, an' daughter be glad o' the
chance, seen' we saint the shudder o' another.
If tuk again' we'd be strung up or shot sure.
Highwaymen or lo^^'aymen, they're the only
ones about these digging that kin gie us

purtekshun, an' I reckon, we may rely on them
for that — so far's they're able."

For a time Kearney was silent, though not
thinking over what the Texan had said ;
much of which had passed through his mind
before. The train of his reflections were
carried further back ; to the point where he
was first brought into contact with Eivas,
by their legs getting linked together. Then
forward throughout the hours and incidents
that came after ; recalling everything that
had occurred, in act as in conversation —
mentally reviewing all, in an endeavour to
solve the problem that was puzzling them.

Seeing him so occupied, and with a suspicion
of how his thoughts were working, the
Texan forbore further speech, and awaited
the result.

If we've fallen among banditti," Kearney
at length said, "it mil be awkward to get away

from them. They'll want us to take a hand
at their trade, and that wouldn't be nice."

Sartine not, Cap. ; anything but agreeable
to either o' us. It goes again the grit o' a
honest man to think o' belonging to a band o'
robbers. But forced to pine 'em that 'ud be
different. Besides, the thins; ain't the same in
Mexico, as 'thud in Texas and the States.
Hear 'isn't looked on as been' so much o' a
disgrace, belong's they don't practise cruelty.
An' I've hern Mexicans say, 'taint fuss, nor
yet so bad, as the way some our noun poltishun
an' lawyers plunder the people. I guess it be
'bout the same, when one gits used to it."

To this quaint rigmarole of reasoning — not
without reason in it, however — Kearney only
replied nth a smile, allowing the Texan toto
continue ; which he did saying :

After all, I don't think they're robbers
any more than monks ; if they be, they're

wonderfully well-believed. A pariter set o'
fellers or better kumj^'ny this chile never war
in turin the hull course of his experience in
Texas, or otherwhars. They ain't like to lead
us into anything' very bad, in the way o'
cruelty or killing'. So I say, let's freeze to em,
till we find they ain't worthy of being froze
to ; then VvX must gie 'em the slip, somehow."

Ah ! if we can," said his fellow filibuster
doubtingly. " But that is the thing for the
far hereafter. The question is what are we todo
now ?"

No guessed at all, Cap., as thar's no
choosing atween. We're born' to be robbers
for a time, or whatsoever else these new
'acquaintances 'o ours be themselves. The's
sure as shooting."

True," returned the other, musingly.
There seems no help for it. It's our fate,
old comrade ; thouo^i one, I trust, we shall be

able to control without turning highwaymen.
I don't think they are that. I can't believe
it."

Nor me neither. One thing, howsomever,
the I lev observed air a beetle queer, an'
sort o' in thar favour."

What thing V

Thar not levin' any weemen among 'em.
I war in the kitchen this morning' 'fore ye war
up, and kedn't see sign o' a petticoat about ;
the cooking' been' all done by men servants.
The, I've hern say, air the way wi' monks ;
but not wi' the other sort. What do you
make o't. Cap?"

I hardly know, Cris. Possibly the Mexican
brigands, unlike those of Italy, don't care
to encumber themselves with a following of
the fair sex."

On t'other hand," pursued the Texan, " it
seems to contrary their been' o' the religious

sort, putting' out sentries as they do. Thar
wor that one we passed last night and this
morning' I seed two go out wi' guns, one takin
each side, and soon after two others coming' in
as if they'd been jest relieved from thar posts.
Thar's a path as leads down from both sides o'
the building."

All very strange, indeed," said Kearney.
But no doubt ws shall soon get explanation
of it. By the way," he added, changing tone
with the subject, " where is the dwarf? What
have they done with him V

"That I can't tell either, Cap. I haven't
seen time o' the critter since he war tuk away
from us by that head man o' the servants, and
I don't wish ever to set eyes on the skunk
again. Oris Rock never was so tired o' a
connexion as wi' the same. Wash !"

I suppose they've got him shut up somewhere,
and intend so keeping him — no doubt

for good reasons. All ! now we're likely to
hear something about the disposal of ourselves.
Yonder comes the man who can tell us !"

This, as the soi-disant Abbot was seen approaching
along the path.

THE ABBOT.

Mig,' said their host, as he rejoined
them, speaking to Kearney
who could alone understand him,
'^ Permit me to offer you a cigar — your comrade
also — with my apologies for having
forgotten that you smoked. Here are both
Savannas and Manilla, several brands of each.
So choose for yourself."

The major-domo, who attended him, carrying

a liiige mahogany case had already placed
it upon one of the rustic benches, and laid
open the lid.

Thanks, holy father," responded Kearney
with a peculiar smile. " If you have no
objection, I'll stick to the Imperator. After
smoking one of them a man need have no
difficulty as to choice."

At which he took an " Emperor " out of the
case.

I'm glad you like them," observed the
generous donor helping him to a light.
*' They ought to be of good quality considering
what they cost and where they come from.
But, Don Florencio, don't let the question of
expense hinder you smoking as many as you
please. My outlay on them was nil; they
were a contribution to the monastery ; though
not exactly a charitable one."

He said this with a sort of inward laugh, as

though some strange history attached to the
Imperator.

A forced contribution, then," thought the
Irishman, the remark having made a strange,
and by no means pleasant impression upon
him.

The Texan had not yet touched the cigars,
and when with a gesture the invitation was
extended to him, he hung back, muttering to
Kearney :

Tell him. Cap., I'd purser a pipe ef he ked
accommodate me wi' the ere article."

What says the Senor Cristoforo V asked
the Abbot.

'' He'd prefer smoking a pipe, if you don't
object, and there be such a thing convenient."

'•' Oh ! ten pipa. I shall see. Gregorio !"

He called after the mayor-domo, who was
returning toward the house.

Never mind, reverend Father," protested

Kearney, " Content yourself with a cigar, Cris,
and don't give trouble."

I'm sorry I spoke o' it," said the Texan.
I daughter be only too gled to git a seegar,
an' it may be he wudn't mind my chain',
stead o' smoking' it ! My stammuck feels
starved for a bit o' dacca. What wouldn't I
gie jest now for a plug o' Jeunes's Ever ! "

There, take one of the cigars and eat it if
you like, I'm sure he'll have no objection."

Availing himself of the leave thus vicariously
accorded, the Texan picked out one of
the largest in the collection and, biting off
about a third, commenced crunching it between
his teeth, as though it was a piece of
sugar-stick. This to the no small amusement
of the Mexican, who, however, delicately refrained
from making remark.

Nor was Oris hindered from having a smoke

as well as a " chew," — The mayor-domo soon
3—2

after appearing with a pipe, a somewhat
eccentric affair he had fished out from the
back regions of the establishment.

Meanwhile their host had himself lit one of
the " Emperors," and was smoking away like a
chimney. A somewhat comical sight at anytime,
or in any place, is a monk with a cigar in
his mouth. But that the Abbot of the Serra
Ajusco was no anchorite they were already
aware, and saw nothing in it to surprise
them.

Seating himself beside Kearney, with face
turned towards the valley, he put the question
: —

What do you think of that landscape,
Don Florencio ?"

Magnificent ! I can't recall having
looked upon lovelier, or one nth greater
variety of scenic detail. It has all the elements
of the subHme and beautiful."

The young Irishman was back in his college
classics with his countryman Burke.

Make use of this," said the Abbot, offering
a small telescope which he drew out. *' 'Twill
give you a better view of things."

Taking the glass and adjusting it to his
sight, Kearney commenced making survey of
the valley, now bringing one portion of it
within the field of telescopic vision, then,
another.

Can you see the Pedregal ?" asked the
Abbot. " It's close in to the mountain's
foot. You'll recognise it by its sombre grey
colour."

Certainly I see it," answered the other,
after depressing the telescope. '' And the
thicket we came through on its further side —
quite distinctly."

Look to the right of that, then you'll
observe a large house, standing in the middle

of the maggie fields. Have you caught

itr

Yes ; why do you ask ?"

Because that house has an interest for mea
very special one. Whom do you suppose
it belongs to ; or I should rather say, did and
ought to belong to V

How should I know, holy Father ?" asked
Kearney thinking it somewhat strange his
being so interrogated.

True," responded the Abbot, " how could
you, my son. But I'll tell you. That
magueyal is mine by right ; though by wrong
'tis now the property of our late host, the
Governor of the Acordada. His reward at the
last confiscation for basely betraying his
country and our cause."

What cause ?" inquired the young Irishman,
laying aside the glass, and showing more
interest in what he heard than that he had

been looking at. Country and cause ! These
were not the words likely to be on the lips of
either monk or hio'hwa^Tnan.

And that the man who had spoken to him
was neither one nor other he had fuller proof
in what was now further said : —

A cause, Senor Irlandes, for which I,
Euperto Pdvas, am ready to lay down life, if
the sacrifice be called for, and so most — I may
say all — of those you've just met at ahnuerzo.
You heard it proclaimed in the toast " Patria y
Libertad !"

Yes. And a grand noble sentiment it is.
One I was gratified to hear."

And surprised as well. Is not that so,
amigo f"

Well, to be frank with you, holy Father,
I confess to something of the sort."

Not strange you should, my son. No
doubt you're greatly perplexed at what you've

THE Free LANCES.

seen and heard since you came up here, with
much before. But the time has come to relieve
you. So light another cigar and listen*'

THE Free LANCES.

KY a Manilla this time," said the
Mexican, as Kearney was reaching
out to take a cigar from the case.
Most people believe that the best can only
come from Cuba. A mistake that. There
are some made in the Philippine Islands equal
in my opinion, superior — to any Savannahs.
I speak of a very choice article, which don't
ever get into the hands of the dealers, and's

only known to the initiated. Some of our
O'lcos import them by way of Acapulco.
Those are a fair sample."

The young Irishman made trial of the weed
thus warmly recommended ; to discover what
contradicted all his preconceived ideas in the
smoking line. He had always heard it said
that the choicest cigars are Savannahs ; but,
after a few whiffs from that Manilla, which
had never seen a cigar shop, he was willing to
give up the " Imperator ".

His host lighting one of the same, thus
proceeded :

Foes, cahallero ; to give you the promised
explanation. That the monks of my community
are of an order neither very devout or
austere, you've already observed no doubt,
and may have a suspicion they're not monks
at all. Soldiers every man ; most having seen
service, and many who have done gallant

deeds. When I speak of them as soldiers,
you will understand it in its true sense, Senor.
With one or two exceptions all have held
commissions in our army, and with a like
limitation, I may say are all gentlemen. The
last revolution, which has again cursed our
country by restoring its chronic tyrant, Santa
Anna, of course threw them out ; the majority,
as myself, being proscribed, with a price stupor
their heads."

'' Then you're not robbers ?"

This was said without thought, the words
involuntarily escaping Kearney lips. But
the counterfeit abbot, so far from feeling
offence at them, broke out into a laugh, good-humouredly
rejoining —

Robbers, amigo mio ! Who told you we
were that T

The Irishman felt abashed, seeing he had
committed himself.

Don Euperto," he exclaimed, hastening to
make the best of his blunder, " I owe you
every apology. It arose from some talk I
heard passing around in the prison. Be
assured, I neither did nor could believe it."

Thank you, Senor !" returned the Mexican.
" Your apologies are appreciated. And,"
he added, putting on a peculiar smile, " in a
way superfluous. I believe we do enjoy that
repute among our enemies ; and to confess the
truth, not without some reason."

Kearney pricked up his ears, perplexity,
with just a shade of trouble, again appearing
upon his face. He said nothing, however,
allowing the other to proceed.

Carrara, yes !" continued the proscribe.
'^ 'Tis quite true we do a little in the plundering
line — now and then. We need doing it,
Don Florencio. But for that I oughtn't have
been able to set so good a breakfast before

you ; nor wines of such quality, nor yet these
delectable cigars. If you look to the right
down there, you'll see the pueblo of San
Augustin, and just outside its suburbs a large
yellow house. From that came our last
supply of drinkable and movable materials,
including those here, mahogany and everything.
A forced contribution, as I've hinted
at. But, senor, I should be sorry to have you
think we levy black-mail indiscriminately.
He from whom they were taken is one of our
bitterest enemies ; equally an enemy of our
country. 'Twas aU in the way of reprisal ;
fair, as you'll admit, when you come to comprehend
the circumstances."

I comprehend them now," returned the
listener, relieved, " quite ; and I trust you will
accept my apology."

Sails arrive pensee,^' responded the Mexican,
who could speak French if not English,

"I do frankly, freely. No reproach to you
for supposing us robbers. I believe many
others do, among whom we make appearance.
Southward, however, in the State of Oaxaca,
we are better known as * the Free Lances '. A
title not so appropriate either, since our
weapons are only at the disposal of the
Eepublic — our lives as well."

But," questioned Kearney, " may I ask
why you are habited as I novv^ see you '?"

For a good reason, amigo. It adds to our
security, giving all sorts of opportunities.
Throughout Mexico, the cowl of the monk is
the best passport a man could be provided
with. Wearing it we go about among the
mountain villages without suspicion, the
people believing that this old monastery, so
long abandoned as to have been forgotten, has
again become the dwelling place of a religious
order. Of course, we don't allow any of the

rustics to approach it. Luckily they are not
curious enouo;]i to care for that, against the
toil of climbing up here. If they attempt it
we have sentinels to stay them. For ourselves
we have learned to play the part of the holy
friar, so that there would be difficulty in
detecting the counterfeit. As it chances we
have with us one or two who once wore the
cowl. These perverts have taught us all the
tricks and passwords current among the
fraternity. Hitherto they have availed us,
and I trust will, till the time arrives for our
casting off our cassock and putting on the
soldier's coat. That day is not distant, Don
Florencio ; nearer than I expected, from what
my comrades have told me since we came up.
The State of Oaxa ca is disaffected ; as indeed the
whole southern side of Acapulco, and a grit is
anticipated ere long — possibly within a month.
Alvarez, who controls in that quarter, will bethe

man to raise it ; and the old Pinto chief
will expect to be joined by the ' Free Lances \
Nor will he be disappointed. We are all
burning to be at it. So, caballero, you see
how it is with us. And now," he added,
changing tone and looking his listener earnestly
in the face, " I have a question to put
to yourself"

What 1" asked the Irishman, seeing that
he hesitated putting it.

Will you be one of us ?"

It was now Kearney's turn to hesitate about
the answer he ought to make. A proposition
fraught with such consequences required consideration.
To what would he be committing
himself if he consented ? And what if he
should refuse ? Besides under the circumstances
was he free to refuse ? That of itself
was a question, a delicate one. He and his
comrade Oris Rock owed their escape to this

strange man, whatever lie might be : and to
separate from him now, even under full permission,
would savour of ingratitude. Still
more after listening to what was further said.
For noting his embarrassment, and deeming it
natural enough the Mexican hastened to relieve
him.

If my proposal be not to your King,
Senor Irlandes, say so ; and without fear of
offence. All the same, you may rest assured
of our protection while you remain with us ;
and I shall do what I can to get you safe out
of the country. At all events, I won't send
you back to the Accorded goal and the
tender care of its governor. So you can
speak frankly without reserve. Are you
willing to be one of us ? "

I am ! " was the answer given without
further hesitation.

Why should he have either hesitated or

I ^

said nay ? In the heart of a hostile country,
an escaped prisoner ; his life, as he felt sure,
forfeited should he be retaken. Joining; Eivas
and his Free Lances might be his sole chance
of saving it. Even had they been banditti
he could not have done better then.

Yes, Don Rupert," he added, " if you
deem me worthy of belonging to your
brotherhood, be it so. I accept your invitation."


"And your comrade, Don Christoforo.
Will he be of the same mind, think you ? "

Sure to be. I take it, I can answer for
him. But you shall hear for yourself.
Rock ! "

He called to the Texan, who, not understanding
their dialogue, had sauntered apart,
chewing away at the Imperator.

Wal, Cap. ; what's up now V he asked
on rejoining them.

They're no robbers. Oris' said Kearney,
speaking freely in their o^ti tongue.

Gled to hear it, I did'nt think they war —
noways. Nor monks neither, I guess 1 "

Nor monks."

"What then, Cap?"

"The same as yourself. Patriots who
have been fighting for their country, and
got defeated. That's why they are here —
in hiding."

"Is, Cap. ; I see it all, char as coon's
track on a mud bar. Enemies o' ole Santy,
who've got beat it thar last rising."

Just so. But they expect another rising
soon, and wish us to join them. I've
agreed and said so. What say you ? "

Lordy, Cap. : what a question to be axed,
an by yourself! Sure this chile air born to
stick to ye, whatsoever ye do. Ef they'd
been brigands I shed a put my conscience

3—3

in my pocket, an goe'd in wi'em all the same ;
belong you're agreed. Nor I wud'nt a
minded turning monk for a spell. But men
who intend fought for freedom ? Hallelujah !
Oris Rock air all thar I Ye may tell him
so."

"He consents," said Kearney, reporting
to the Mexican ; " and willingly as myself
Indeed, Don Euperto, we ought both to
regard it as a grace — an honour — to be so
associated, and we shall do the best we canto
show ourselves worthy of it."

^' Mil gracious, Senor ! The grace and
honour are all given to us. Two such
valientes, as I know you to be, mil be no
slight acquisition to our strength. And
now, may I ask you to assume the garb
which as you see is our present uniform ?
That by way of precaution for the time.
You'll find suitable raiment inside. I've

given Gregorio orders to get it ready. So
you see, Cataracts, I've been counting
upon you."

Gehosofat ! " exclaimed the Texan, when
told of the dress he was expected to put on.
What wi New-Orleen's store close, an prison
duds, an' the like, this chile lev hed a
goodish wheen o' changes since he stripped
off his ole hunting' shirt. An' now a going
in for a monk ! Wal ; tho' I mayn't bethe
most sanctified, I reckon I'll be the tallest
in thar monastery."

ST. AUGUSTINE OF THE CAVES.

designation

NE of the pleasantness villages in the
valley of Mexico is San Augustin
de las Cuevas — Tlalpam by Aztec
both names due to some remarkable
caverns in the immediate neighbourhood.
It is some ten or twelve miles
from the capital, on the southern or Acapulco
road, just where this, forsaking the valley
level begins to ascend the Sierra, passing

over wliicli by Cruz del Marques, it continues
on through the sierras talents of Cuernavaca
and Guerrero to the famed port of the
Pacific.

San Augustin is a 23!ie6?o, endowed with
certain municipal privileges. It boasts of an
alcalde-may 07^ sith other corporate officers,
and a staff of alguezils, or policemen.

The heads of departments are mostly men
of pure Spanish race — " gente de razor," as
they proudly proclaim themselves — though
many are in reality of mixed blood, Mestizos.
Of this are the better class of shopkeepers,
few in number, the gente de razor at best
forming a scarce discernible element in the
population, which is mainly made up of the
brown aborigines.

At a certain season of the year, however,
paler complexions show in the ascendant.
This during; carnival time — 'alas Pascuas'\

Then the streets of San Augustin are
crowded with gay promenaders ; while carriages
and men on horseback may be seen
in continuous stream passing to and fro between
it and the capital. In Las Pascal
week, one day with another, half Mexico is
there engaged in a gambling orgie, as Londoners
at Epsom during the Derby. More
like Homburg and Monaco, though ; since
the betting at Tlalpam is not upon the swiftness
of horses, but done \\dth dice and cards.
The national game, " monte," there finds
fullest illustration, grand marquees being
erected for its play — real temples erected to
the goddess Fortuna. Inside these may be
seen crowds of the strangest composition, in
every sense heterogeneous ; military officers,
generals and colonels, down to the lowest
grade, even sergeants and corporals, sitting
at the same table and staking on the same

cards ; members of Congress, Senators, Cabinet
Ministers, and, upon occasions, the
Chief of the State, jostling the ragged lepers,
and not unfrequently standing elbow to
elbow with the footpad and salvador ! —
Something stranger still, ladies compose part
of this miscellaneous assemblage ; dames of
high birth and proud bearing, but in this
carnival of cupidity not disdaining to " punt"
on the sofa or cavalry, while brushing skirts
with bare-armed, bare-footed rustic damsels,
and pohlanas, more elaborately robed, but
with scantier reputation.

After all, it is only Baden on the other
side of the Atlantic ; and it may be said
in favour of San Augustin, the fury lasts
for only a few days, instead of a whole
season. Then the monte banks disappear,
nth their dealers and croupiers ; the great
tents are taken down ; the gamesters gentle

and simple scatter off, most going back to the
city ; and the little pueblo Tlalpam, resuming
its wonted tranquillity, is scarce thought of
till Carnival comes again.

In its normal condition, though some might
deem it rather dull, it is nevertheless one
of the pleasantness residential villages in the
Valley. Picturesquely situated at the foot
of the southern Sierras, which form a bold
mountain background, it has on the other
side water scenery in the curious Laguna de
Xochimilco, while the grim Pedregal also
approaches it, giving variety to its surroundings.


Besides its fixed population there is one
that may be termed floating or intermittent ;
people who come and go. These are certain
rico " who chiefly affect its suburbs, where
they have handsome houses — casas de campo.
Not in hundreds, as at San Angel and Tacu-

baya, Tlalpam being at a greater and more
inconvenient distance from the capital. Still
there are several around it of first-class,
belonging to families principally though
occupied by them only at intervals, and fora
few days or weeks at a time.

One of these, owned by Don Ignacio Yale
was a favourite place of residence
with him ; a tranquil retreat of which he
was accustomed to avail himself whenever
he could get away from his ministerial duties.
Just such an interregnum had arisen sometime
after the stirring incidents we have
recorded, and he went to stay at his San
Augustin house with his daughter, the Con-des
Almonte going with them as their guest.
Since their last appearance before the reader,
all three had passed through scenes of trial.
An investigation had been gone into regarding
the Calle de Plateros affair — private,

however, before Santa Anna himself, the
world not being made the wiser for it. Its
results were all in their favour, thanks to the
stern, stubborn fidelity of Jose who lied
like a very varlet. Such a circumstantial
story told he, no one could suspect him of
complicity in the escape of the forzados ; far
less that his mistress, or the Condesa Almonte
had to do with it.

\ Don Ignacio, too, had done his share to
hinder discovery of the truth. For, in the
end it was found necessary to take him into
the secret, the missing cloak and pistols,
with several mysterious incidents, calling for
explanation. But in making a clean breast
of it, his daughter had felt no fear of being
betrayed by him. He was not the father
to deal harshly with his child ; besides, it
was something more — a real danger. In
addition, she knew how he was affected

towards the man she had aided to escape —
that he held Don Florencio in highest esteem ;
looked upon him as a dear friend, and in a
certain tacit way had long ago signified
approval of him for a son-in-law. All these
thoughts passed through Luisa Valverde's
mind while approaching her father, and steeling
herself to make confession of that secret
she might otherwise have kept from him.

The result was not disappointing. Don
Ignacio consented to the deception, and they
were saved. Whatever the suspicions of
Santa Anna and his adjutant, both were
baffled about that affair, at least for the
time.

Alike had they been frustrated in their
pursuit of the escapade. Despite the most
zealous search through the Pedregal and
elsewhere, these could not be found, nor
even a trace of them. Still they were not

given up. Every town and village in the
valley, in the mountains around, and the
country outside were visited by soldiers or
spies — every spot like to harbour the fugitives.
Pickets were placed everywhere and
patrols despatched, riding the roads by night
as by day, all proving abortive.

After a time, however, this vigorous action
became relaxed Not that they who
had dictated were less desirous of continuing
it ; but because a matter of more importance
than mere personal spite or vengeance
was soon likely to declare itself, and
threaten their own safety. Talk was beginning
to be heard, though only in whispers,
and at a far distance from the capital, of a
new pi^onunciamento in preparation. And in
making counter - preparations, the Dictator
had now enough to occupy all his energies ;
not knowing the day or the hour he might

again hear the cry he so dreaded, *' Patria y
Liberty ad ".

Meanwhile the people had ceased to speak
of the stirring episode which had occurred in
the Calle de Plateros ; thought strange only
from the odd circumstances attendant, and
the fact of two of the fugitives being Tenants.
The city of Mexico has its daily newspapers,
and on the morning after a full account of
it appeared in El Diario and Fel Monitor.
For all it was but the topic of a week ; in
ten days no more heard of it ; in a month
quite forgotten, save by those whom it specially
concerned. So varied are the events,
so frequent the changes, so strange the
'' Costs de Mexico ! "

Over THE CLIFF.

OR some time after their arrival at
the old monastery, neither Kearney
nor Oris Rock saw aught of their
late '' fourth fellow " prisoner — the hunchback.
They cared not to inquire after him ;
the Texan repeating himself by saying ; —
*this chile don't want ever to sit eyes on
his ugly picture again ". They supposed that
he was still there, however, somewhere about
the buildings.

And so was lie, with a chain attached to
his leg, the same he had shared with Rock,
its severed end now padlocked to a ring bolt ;
and the apartment he occupied had as much
of the prison aspect as any cell in the Acorn
No doubt, in days gone by, many a
refractory brother had pined and done
penance therein for breach of monastic
discipline.

Why the misshapen creature was so kept
needs little explanation ; for the same reason
as prompted to bringing him thither. Helpless
as he might appear, he was not harmless ;
and Don Euperto knew that to restore him to
liberty would be to risk losing his own, with
something more. Though safely bestowed,
however, no severity was shown him. He had
his meals regularly, and a bed to sleep on ; if
but a pallet ; quite as good as he had been
accustomed to. Moreover, after some time

liacl elapsed he was relieved from this close
confinement during the hours of the day. A
clever actor, and having a tongue that could
*' wheedle with the devil," he had wheedled
with the mayor-domo to granting him certain
indulgences ; among them being allowed to
spend part of his time in the kitchen and
scullery. Not in idleness, however, but occupied
with work for which he had proved
himself well qualified. It was found that he
had once been " boots " in a 2^osado, which
fitted him for usefulness in many ways.

In the cocina of the old convent his temper
was sorely tried, the other " mozos " making
cruel sport of him. But he bore it nth a
meekness very different to what he had shown
while in the Acordada.

Thus acquitting himself, Gregorio, who had
him in special charge, began to regard him asa
useful if not ornamental addition to his

domestic staff of the establishment. Notwithstanding,
the precaution was still continued
of locking him at night and re-attaching the
chain to his ankle. This last was more
disagreeable than aught else he had to endure.
He could bear the jibes of his fellow-scullions,
but that fetter sorely vexed him ; as night
after night he was accustomed to say to the
mayor domo as he was turning the key in its
clasp,

"It's so uncomfortable, Senor Don Gregory,"
was his constantly recurring formula.
Keeps me from sleeping, and's very troublesome
when I want to turn over, as I often do
on account of the pains in my poor humped
shoulders. Now, why need you put it on?
Surely you're not afraid of me trying to get
away ? Ha, ha ! that would be turning one's
back upon best friends, Cascades / I fare too
well here to think of changing quarters.
3—4

Above all going into the Acordada ; where I'd
have to go sure, if I were to show my face in
the city again. Oh, no, Senor ! you don't
catch me leaving this snug crib, so long's you
allow me to board and bed in it. Only I'd
like you to let me off from that nasty thing.
It's cold too ; interferes with my comfort
generally. Do, good Don Gregorio ! For this
one night try me without it. And if you're
not satisfied with the result then put it on ever
after, and I won't complain, I promise you."

In somewhat similar terms he had made
appeals for many nights in succession, but
without melting the heart of the " Good
Don Gregorio ".

At length, however, it proved effectual.
Among various other avocations he had
been a Zapartero, of the class cobbler, and
on a certain day did service to the mayor-domo
by mending his shoes. For which

he received payment in the permission to
pass that night without being discomposed
by the chain.

It's so very kind of you, Don Gregorio ! "
he said, when made aware of the grace to be
given to him. " I ought to sleep sound this
night anyhow. But whether I do or not, I
shall pray for you before going to bed all
the same, Buenos niches / "

It was twilight outside, but almost total
darkness thin the ceU, as the mayor-domo
turned to go out of it. Otherwise he might
have seen on the dwarfs features an expression
calculated to make him repent his act
of kindness, and instantly undo it. Could
he have divined the thoughts at that moment
passing through Zorillo's mind, the clasp
would have quickly closed around the latter's
leg, despite all gratitude due to him for
the patching of the shoes.

If I can get out' lie commenced in mental
soliloquy, as the foot-fall of the mayor-domo
died away in the distant corridor, " out,
and away from them, my fortune's made ;
all sorts of good things in store for me.
From this time forth I needing fear to
present myself at the door of the Acordada ;
walk right into it. No danger of Don Pedro
keeping me there now. Instead, I should be
sent out again with a free pardon and a full
purse. Chingara; talk of a cat in the
cupboard : here are a score of them — half a
hundred ! And when I let them out —
aha ! "

He paused ; then rising to his feet, moved
across to the door, and laid his ear against
it to listen. He heard sounds, but they were
sounds of merriment — the counterfeit monks
at their evening meal — and did not concern

him.

'* What a bit of luck it may turn out after
all, my getting coupled to that great brute
and brought here ! That is if all goes welland
I can give them the slip. First, to make
sure about the possibility of getting out of
this hole. Carrai ! I may be counting my
chickens in the eo-o;s."

Leaving the door, he glided across to the
window, and set himself square against it,
as if to measure its breadth by that of his
own body. It was but a slit, unglazed, a
single iron bar, placed vertically, dividing
the aperture into two. Without removing
this he could not possibly pass through. But
he had the means to remove it ; that file,
already known to the reader, which he had
contrived to get possession of, and for days
kept secret in his cell. First, however, he
must see whether it was worth while using
it ; for during all the time of his being there

he had never been allowed an opportunity to
approach the window and look out.

Leaning forward into the recess, he thrust
his head between the bar and jamb, so far
out as to give him a view of the ground
below. This was solid rock, the crest of a
steep slope, from which the wall rose as
above a buttress. But there was a ledge,
some ten or twelve feet under the sill, narrow,
but wide enough to afford footing, which led
off to more level ground. How was he to
reach it ?

He knew or he would not have acted ashe
now did. For without spending another
second in the survey, he drew back from the
window, plunged his hand under his bed mat,
drew forth the file, and commenced rasping
away at the bar. Not noisily or in any
excited haste. Even if the obstacle were
removed, the time had not come for his attempt

to pass out. He would wait for an
hour after midnight, when all had gone to
their beds.

Eaten with rust, the iron was easily sawed
through, a clean cut being made near its lower
end. Then, laying aside the file, and grasping
the bar, he wrenched it out of the soldering.
If diminutive in body, his arms were
sinewy and strong as those of a coalheaver.

This task accomplished, he turned to his
pallet and taking up the old blanket allowed
him for a covering, began to tear it into strips.
He meant to make a rope of it to lower
himself down outside. But finding it quite
rotten, and doubting whether it would bear
his weight, he desisted and sat for a time
considering. Not long till he bethought himself
of something more suitable for his purpose
the chain.

Bah !" he exclaimed, tossing aside the rags

he had commenced splicing together, " why
didn't I think of that ? Well, it's not too late
yet. Good three yards — long enough. And
the stupid has left the key behind which fits
both ends. So, Mr. Chain, considering the
world of worry and trouble you've been to me
it's time, and only fair, you should do me a
good turn by way of recompense. After
you've done it, I'll forgive you."

While muttering this quaint apostrophe, he
commenced groping about over the floor — not
for the chain, but the key, which he knew
Gregorio had left after releasing his leg from
the clasp. The mayor-domo had either forgotten,
or did not think it was worth while
taking it away.

Having found it, he felt his way to the ringbolt
and unlocking the clasp at that end
returned to the window, taking the chain with
him. Having made one end fast around the

stump of the bar, lie lowered the other do^ii
outside, cautiously, without a tinkle of its
links. And now again looking out and below,
he was delighted to see that it reached Within
a foot or two of the ledge. All this done he
once more sat down on the side of the bed, to
await the hour of midnight.

But he was not long quiescent, when a
thought occurring; caused him to resume action.

Why not try it now T he mentally interrogated.
" They're all in the Refectory,
having a fine time of it, drinking their famous
wines. Some grand occasion, I heard one of
the mozos say. There oughtn't be a better
chance for me than this very minute — maybe
not so good. Carrara ! I'll risk it now."

Quickly at the words he gilded back to the
window, climbed up into it, and squeezing out
through the aperture, let himself down on the
chain, link by link, as a monkey making

descent of a lliana in the forests of the tierra
cadence.

Soon as he found himself safe landed he let
go the chain, and after a minute or so spent in
silent reconnaissance of the ledge, commenced
moving off along it.

Eight he was in closing that early hour,
for the way he must needs take led out into
the open ground, in front of the building,
where at a later one a watch would have been
stationed. There was none there now, and
without stop or challenge he passed on and
down.

Though they had never allowed him to
go outside the building, he perfectly remembered
the path by which he and the
others had reached it, on that memorable night
after their escape from the chain-gang. He
recalled the two steep slopes, one above the
other, with a narrow shelf between, on which

they encountered the sentinel, who had
hailed, " Queen viva ? "

Sure to be one there now, and to such
hail what answer could he make ?

On this he reflected while descending the
upper slope. The darkness due to the overshadowing
trees made it necessary for him
to go slowly, so giving him time. But it
did not hinder his keeping to the path.
With his long arms like the tentacles of
an octopus he was able to direct his course,
now and then using them to grasp overhanging
branches, or the parasites dependant
therefrom. Withal he went cautiously, and
so silently, that the sentinel — for sure enough
one was there — heard no noise to warn him
of an enemy behind. In his monkish garb,
he was standing on the outer edge of the
shelf rock, his face turned to the valley, which
was just beginning to show silvery white

under the rays of a rising moon. Perhaps,
like Don Euperto, lie was gazing on some
spot, a house, endeared to him as the home
of his childhood ; but from which, as the
leader of the Free Lances, he had been bereft
by the last confiscation. Possibly he was
indulging in the hope of its being soon restored
to him, but least of all dreaming of
danger behind.

It was there, notwithstanding — in fiendish
shape and close proximity. A creature
squatted like a toad, human withal, saying
to himself,

*what wouldn't I give for a knife Tvith
a blade six inches long ! "

Then with a sudden change of thought,
seeing: the chance to do without the knife,
making a dash forward, with the ape-like
arms extended, and pushing the sentinel over !

The cry that came from the latter on



feeling the impulse from behind, was stifled
as he went swirling down to the bottom
of the cliff.

ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.

E A D ! " muttered the inhuman
wretch, as he stood upon the
spot late occupied by his victim,
looking down over the cliff. " Dead he
must be ; unless a man can fall two hundred
feet and still live ; which isn't likely.
That clears the way, I take it ; and unless
I have the ill-luck to meet some one coming
up — a straggler — it'll be all right. As sound

ascends, I ought to hear them before they
could see me. I shall keep my ears open'*

Saying which he commenced the descent
of the second slope, proceeding in the same
cautious way as before.

The path was but a ledge, which, after
running fifty yards in a direct line, made
an abrupt double back in the opposite direction,
all the while obliging downwards.
Another similar zig-zag, with a like length
of declivity traversed, and he found himself
at the clifi''s base, among shadowy, thick
standing trees. He remembered the place ;
and that before reaching it on their way
up they had followed the trend of the cliff"
for more than a quarter of a mile. So taking
this for his guide, he kept on along
the back track.

Not far, before seeing that which brought
him to a stop. If he had entertained any

doubt about the sentinel being dead, it would
have been resolved now. There lay the man's
body among the loose rocks, not only lifeless,
but shapeless. A break in the continuity
of the timber let the moonlight through,
giving the murderer a full view of him he
had murdered.

The sentinel had fallen upon his back, and
lay with his face upward, his crushed body
doubled over a boulder ; the blood was welling
from his mouth and nostrils, and the
open eyes glared ghastly in the white, weird
light. It was a sight to inspire fear in the
mind of an ordinary individual, even in that
of a murderer. But it had no effect on this
strange lusus of humanity, whose courage
was equal to his cruelty. Instead of giving
the body a wide berth, and scared-Hke stealing
past, he walked boldly up to it, saying in
apostrophe —

So you're there ! Well, you need not
y blame me, but your luck. If I hadn't pushed
you over, you'd have shot me like a dog,
or brained me with the butt of your gun.
Aha ! I was too much for you, Mr. Monk
or soldier, which ever you were, for you're
neither now."

Just possible," he continued, changing
the form of his monologue, " He may have
a purse ; the which I'm sure to stand in need
of before this time tomorrow. If without
money his weapons may be of use to me."

With a nimbleness which bespoke him no
novice at trpng pockets, he soon touched the
bottom of all those on the body, to find them
emjDty.

Bah," he ejaculated, drawing back with
a disappointed air, " I might have known
there Vas nothing in them. Whatever cash
they've had up there has been spent long ago,

and their wine will soon be out too. His gun
I don't care for ; besides, I see it's broken ; —
yes, the stock snapped clean off. But this
stiletto it's worth, taking with me. Even if I
shouldn't need it in the way of a weapon, it
looks like a thing Mr. Pawnbroker would
appreciate."

Snatching the dagger — a silver-hilted one —
from the corpse of its ill-starred owner, he
secreted it inside his tattered rag of a coat, and
without delay proceeded on.

Soon after he came to a point where the
path forsaking the cliff turned to the left,
down the slope of the mountain. He knew
that would take him into the Pedregal, where
he did not desire to go. Besides his doubts
of being able to find the way through the
lava field, there was no particular need for
his attempting so difficult a track. All he
wanted was to get back to the city by the

most direct route, and as soon as possible
into the presence of a man of whom during
late days he had been thinking much. For
from this man he much expected, in return
for a tale he could tell him. It must be told
direct, and for this reason all caution was
required. He might fall into hands that
would not only hinder him from relating it
in the right quarter, but prevent his telling
it at all.

Just where the path diverged to the left
going down to the Pedregal, a mass of rocks
rose bare above the tops of the trees. Clambering
to its summit he obtained a view of
what lay below ; the whole valley bathed in
bright moonlight, green meadows, fields of
maize, and maguey, great sheets of water
with haze hanging over them, white and
gauzy as a bridal veil. The city itself was
distinguishable at a long distance, and in places

nearer sucklings of white telling of some
puehlita, or single spots where stood a rancho
or hacienda. Closer still, almost under his
feet, a clump of those nothings was more
conspicuous ; which he recognised as the
pueblo of San Augustin. A narrow ribbon-like
strip of greyish white passing through it,
and on to the city, he knew to be the Great
Southern or Acapulco road, which enters the
capital by the garita of San Antonio de Bad.
This route he decided on taking.

Having made note of the necessary bearings,
he slipped back down the side of the
rock, and looked about for a path leading to
the right.

Not long till he discovered one, a mere
trace made by wild animals through the
underwood — sufficiently practicable for him,
as he could work his way through any
tangle of thicket. Sprawling along it, and

rapidly, despite all obstructions, he at length
came out on the Acapulco road, a wide
cause way, nth the moon full upon it.

The track was easy and clear even now,
too clear to satisfy him. He would have
preferred a darker night. San Augustin
had to be passed through, and he knew
that in it were both serene and alguazils.
Besides, he had heard the moxos at thu
monastery speak of troops stationed there,
and patrols at all hours along the roads
around. If taken up by these he might
still hope to reach his intended destination ;
but neither in the time he desired, nor the
way he wished. He must approach the
man, with whom he meant seeking an
interview, not as a prisoner but voluntarily.
And he must see this man soon, to make
things effectual, as the reward he was
dreaming of sure.

Urged by these reflections, he made no
further delay; but taking to the dusty
road moved in all haste along it. In one
way the moon was in his favour. The
causeway was not straight, for it was still
a deep descent towards the valley, and
carried by zig-zags ; so that at each angle
he was enabled to scan the stretch ahead,
and see that it was clear before exposing
himself upon it. Then he would advance
rapidly on the next turning point, stop
again and reconnoitre.

Thus alternately making traverses and
pauses, he at length reached the outskirts
of the puehio, unchallenged and unobserved.
But the problem was how to pass through
it ; all the more difficult at that early hour.
He had heard the church clock tolling the
hours as he came down the mountain, and
he knew it had not struck ten. A beautiful

nio:]at, the villa o^ers would be all abroad ;
and how was he to appear in the street
without attracting notice — he above all men ?
His deformity of itself would betray him.
An expression of blackest bitterness came
over his features as he thus reflected. But
it was not a time to indulge in sentimentalities.
San Augustin must be got through
somehow, if he could not find a way around it.
For this last he had been looking sometime
both to the right and left. To his
joy, just as he caught sight of the first houses —
villa residences they were, far straggling along
the road — a lane running in behind them
seemed to promise what he was in search of.
From its direction it should enable him to
turn the village, without the necessity of
passing through the plaza, or at all entering
upon the streets. Without more ado he
doomed into the lane.

It proved the very sort of way lie was
wishing for ; dark from being overshadowed
with trees. A high park-like wall extended
along one side of it, within which were the
trees, their great boughs drooping down over.

Keeping close in to the wall he glided on,
and had got some distance from the main
road, when he saw that which brought him
to a sudden stop — a man approaching from
the opposite direction. In the dim light,
the figure was as yet barely discernible, but
there was a certain something in its gait —
the confidential swagger of the policeman —
which caught the practised eye of Zorillo,
involuntarily drawing from him the muttered
speech —

Malta sea ! An alguazil ! "

Whether the man was this or not, he must
be avoided ; and, luckily for the dwarf, the
means of shunning him were at hand, easy

as convenient. It was but to raise this long
arms above bis bead, lay bold of one of the
overhanging branches, and draw himself np
to the top of the wall ; wbicb be did upon
the instant. It was a structure of adobes,
with a coping quite a yard in width, and laid
flat along this, be was altogether invisible,
to one passing below.

Tbe man, alguazil or not, neither saw bim
nor suspected bis being there, but walked
tranquilly on.

"VYben be was well beyond ear-shot, the
dwarf deeming himself safe, was about to
drop back into the lane, w^ben a murmur of
voices prompted bim to keep bis perch. They

brooks, and gradually becoming more distinct ;

already observed that the enclosure was a

grand ornamental garden with walks, fountains
and flowers ; a large house on its further side.

Presently the speakers appeared — two young
ladies sauntering side by side along one of
the walks, the soft moonlight streaming down
upon them. As it fell full upon their faces,
now turned toward the wall, the dwarf started
at a recognition, inwardly exclaiming : —

Santissima ! — The senoritas of the carriage
! "

A TALE OF Starvation

T was the garden of Don Ignacio's
casa de campo ; the ladies, his
daughter and the Condesa. The
lovely night, with balm in the air and a bright
moon shining through the sky, had drawn
them out, and they strolled through the
grounds, keeping step, as it were, to that
matchless melody, the song of the czenzontle.
But note of no nightingale was in their

thoughts, which were engrossed by graver
themes.

'Tis so strange our never hearing from
them, and not a word of them. What do you
make of it. Ysabel ? Is it a bad sign ?"

The question was asked by the Dona Luisa.

That wee haven't heard from them is — ina
way," responded the Countess. " Yet that
may be explained, too. The probability is
from the roads being all watched and guarded,
as we know they are, they'd be cautious about
communicating with us. If they've sent a
messenger — which I hope they haven't — he
must have been intercepted and made
prisoner. And, then, the message ; that
might compromise us. But I know Euperto
will be careful Not to have heard of themis
all for the best — the very best. It should
almost assure us that they're still free, and safe
somewhere. Had they been recaptured we'd

have known before this. All Mexico would
be talking about it."

True' assented Don Ignacio's daughter,
with a feeling of relief. " They cannot have
been retaken. But I wonder where they are
now."

"So I myself, Lusita. I hope, however,
not at that old monastery of which Euperto
gave me a description in one of his letters.
It's somewhere up in the mountains. But
with the country all around so occupied by
troops it would seem an unsafe place. I trust
they've got over the Sierra, and down to
Acapulco. If they have, we needn't feel so
very anxious about them."

Why not, Ysabel ? "

Why not. Ah ! that's a question you
haven't yet come to understand. But never
mind the reason now. You'll know it in good
time ; and when you do, I've no fear but
you'll be satisfied ; your father too."

Don Ignacio's daughter was both puzzled
and surprised at the strange words. But she
knew the Countess had strange ways ; and,
though a bosom friend, was not without some
secrets she kept to herself. This was one of
them, no doubt, and she forbore pressing for
an explanation.

What the Condesa hinted at was that
disaffection in the south, the expected piv-
nunciamento, which, if successful, would not
only depose the Dictator, but of course also
his Cabinet Ministers, her friend's father
among them. With some knowledge of coming
events, she declined imparting this to
the Dona Luisa through delicacy. Eight
was she, also, in her surmise as to the
messenger ; none had been intercepted, none
having been sent out, just for the reason
surmised by her.

They had made a turn or two of the

grounds, thus conversing, when both came
to a sudden stop. Simultaneously uttering
exclamations of alarm, '' Santissima ! ^^ and
Madre che Dios''

'* What can it be ? " gasped Dona Luisa.
Is it a man ? "

No wonder she should so doubtingly interrogate,
since her question referred to that
strange creature on the top of the wall,
seeming more ape than human being.

That he was human, however, was to be
proved by his being gifted with the power
of speech, put forth on the instant after.
Before the Countess could make answer to
the question (of course overheard by him),
he interposed, saying —

Pray, don't be alarmed, your ladyships,
at a poor, miserable creature like me. I
know that my body is anything but
shapely ; but my soul — that I trust is different.

But, Senoritas, surely you remember
me?"

While speaking, lie had raised himself into
an upright attitude, and the moonlight falling
upon him showed his shape in all its grotesqueness
of outline. This, with his words,
at once recalled their having seen him before.
Yes ; it was the enano, whom the big Texan
had swung up to the box of their carriage.

Astonishment hindering reply to his interrogatory,
he continued :

Well, your ladyships, I'm sorry you
don't recognise me ; the more from my being
one of your best friends, or, at all events,
the friend of your friends."

Of whom do you speak, sir ? " asked the
Countess, first to recover composure, the
Dona Luisa echoing the interrogatory. Both
were alike anxious for the answer, better
than half divining.

Two worthy gentlemen, who, like my
poor self, had the misfortune to get shut
up in the Acordada ; more than that, set
to work in the filthy sewers. Thanks to
the luck of your ladyship's carriage coming
past at a convenient time, we all escaped ;
and so far have been successful in eluding
the search that's been made for us."

'you have succeeded — all?" both asked in a
breath, their eagerness throwing aside reserve.

"Oh! yes; as I've said, so far. But it's
been hard times with us in our hiding place ;
so hard, indeed, we might well have wished
ourselves back in the prison."

How so, sir ? Tell us all ! You needn't
fear to speak out : we'll not betray you."

'' For Dios ! I'm not afraid of your ladyships
doing that. Why should I, since I'm
here on account of your own friends, and on
an errand of mercy ? "

An errand of mercy ? "
3—6

Yes. And one of necessity as well. Ah !
that far more."

Go on, sir ! Please tell us what it is ! "
Well, Senoritas, I've been deputed on
a foraging expedition. For we're in a terrible
strait — all four of us. You may remember
there were four."

We do. But, how in a terrible strait ? "
How ! Why, for want of food ; starving.
Up in the mountains, where we've been
hiding for now nearly a month, all we've
had to live upon was wild fruits and roots ;
often eating them raw, too. We aren't any
of us venture down, as the roads all round
have been beset by spies and soldiers. It's
only in sheer desperation I've stolen through
them ; the Senor Don Rupert sending me
to San Augustin in the hope I might be able
to pick up some provisions. I was just
slipping the village the back way, when an

alguazil coming along made it necessary forme
to climb np here and Mde myself. The
unlucky part of it all is, that even if I get
safe in, I haven't the wherewith to buy the
eatables, and must beg them. That I fear
won't be easy ; people are so hard-hearted."

For a time his surprised listeners stood
silent, giving way to sad reflections. Florence
and Euperto starving !

May I hope," continued the lying wretch,
"your ladyships will let me look upon this
accidental encounter as a God-send, and that
you will give me something to buy "

0, sir ! " interrupted the Countess, " we
will give you that. Luisa, have you any
money in your purse ? I haven't in mine —
nothing to signify."

Nor I either — how unfortunate ! We
must "

*' Never mind money, your ladyships ;

money's worth will do quite as well. A reloja,
rings, anything in the way of jewellery. I
chance to know a place in the village where I
can convert them into cash."

Here, take this ! " cried the Countess,
handing him her watch, the same which
had been hypothecated to Jose, but redeemed
by a money payment.

And this ! " said the Dona Luisa, also
holding out a watch, both of which he speedily
took possession of.

"tis very generous of your ladyships,"
he said, stowing them away among his rags,
the proceeds of these ought to support us fora
long time, even allowing for the reduced rate
I'll have to accept from the pawnbroker.
Afterwards we must do the best we can."

As he spoke his little sparkling eyes were
avariciously bent upon certain other objects
he saw scintillating in the moonlight — bracelets,

rings upon their fingers and in their
ears. The hint was hardly needed. Enough
for them the thought that more help might
be required by those dear to them, and at a
time when they could not extend it.

In less than five minutes after both had
divested themselves of every article in the
way of gold, or gems, adorning them. They
even plucked the pendants from their ears,
thrusting all indiscriminately into the outstretched
hands of the hunchback.

'' Gracias ! — mil gracias!^' he ejaculated,
crowding everything into his pocket. " But
your ladyships ^dll scarce care to accept thanks
from me. 'Twill be more to your satisfaction
to know that your generosity vri]! be the
saving of valuable lives, two of them, if I
mistake not, very dear to you. Oh ! won't
the Senores Don Euperto and Don Florencio
be delighted at the tale I shall take back — the

Virgin seeing me safe ! Not for the provisions
I may carry, but how I obtained the means
of purchasing them. But as time's pressing,
Senorita, I won't say a word more, only
Adios ! "

Without waiting for permission to depart
or rejoinder of any kind, he slipped down
from the wall, and disappeared on its other
side.

It was an abrupt leave-taking, which alike
surprised and disappointed them. For they
had many questions to ask, and intended
asking him — many anxieties they wished set
at rest.

AN ENCOUNTER WITH OLD
ACQUAINTANCES.

Passing out of the San Augustin
towards the city, the great
National Eoad, as abbacy said,
touches upon the Pedregal, the lava rocks
here and there rising cliff-like over it. On
the other side are level meadows stretching
to the shore of the Laguna de Xochimilco ;
this last overgrown with a lush aquatic

vegetation called the cinna, at a distance
appearing more pastureland than lake.
Excellent pasturage is afforded on the strip
between ; that end of it adjacent to the
pueblo being apportioned among several
of the rich proprietors of villas, who turn
their household stock upon it, as milch kine,
and horses kept for the saddle or carriage.

Just about the time when the hunchback
was abruptly bidding " Adios " to the ladies,
a man might have been seen moving along
this part of the road at some half mile
distance from the skirts of the village, with
face turned cityw^ard. But that he had no
intention of journeying so far was evident
both by his gait and the character of his
dress. He was going at a slow walk, now
and then loitering, as if time was of little
consequence. Moreover, he was in his shirt
sleeves, and without the universal serape,

which often serves for both cloak and coat.
Otherwise his garb was the ordinary stable
wear of a Mexican gentleman's servant ;
wide velveteen trousers open along the
outer seams, and fended with leather at
breech and bottoms. " Bates " and a black
glaze hat completed his habiliments, with
a scarf of China crape, the cliammora, around
his waist. Scanning the face shadowed by
the broad rim of his sombrero, it was seen
to be that of Jose, Don Ignacio's groom ;
while his errand along that road could be
guessed, by seeing what he carried over his
arm — a couple of slip halters. The horses,
for whom they were intended, were to be
seen standing at a gate, a little further,
having browsed their fill ; a pair of greys,
recognisable as the famous prisoner; all the
easier now from one of them showing a split
ear. They had been turned out to cool

their loves on the soft meadow sward, and
he was on his way to take them back to
their stable.

Along the other side of the road, for a
stretch of some distance, extended the Petrel
forming a low ridge with a precipitous
face towards the causeway. As the cicero
got up to where his pets were expecting him,
he saw a coyote standing upon the crest cliff,
just opposite the horses, in an attitude and
with an air as if it had been holding conversation
with them. Solely for frolic's sake, he
made a rush towards it, giving a swoop and
swinging the halters around his head. Of
course, the frighted animal turned tail, and
retreated ; instantly disappearing from his
sight.

The little spurt had carried him in under
the shadow of the rocks ; and as he faced
round to recross the moonlit causeway, he saw

coming along it that which, by some mysterious
instinct, prompted him to keep his place.
After all, no mystery about it ; for in the
diminutive, crab-like form seen approaching,
he recognised the dwarf-hunchback who had
shared the box seat with him on that day
never to be forgotten.

Nothing had been heard of the creature,
since, so far as Jose knew ; and, therefore, it
might be supposed his appearance would have
been welcome, promising some news of those
with whom he had been last seen. But so far
from the cocker o stepping out into the road to
receive him, he but drew closer to the cliff,
where an embayment in black shadow promised
him perfect concealment.

Com aft or Zorillo came shuffling alonsr
thro:i/a the dust, keeping close to the shaded
si le ol the road. Having; cleared the skirts of
the village, however, he was less careful now.

Not likely there would be anyone abroad at
that hour — for it had gone ten — but if so,
there was the Pedregal alongside, to which he
could retreat. Evidently he had not seen
Jose, as when first seen himself he was turning
a corner, and the other had been for sometime
in shadow.

When nearly opposite the meadow gate he
also made a stop, with a start, at perceiving
the two horses' heads stretched over it, one
vdth. a cleft ear ! His start came through
recognition of them.

Oho !" he exclaimed, " you there, too, my
noble prisoner ? Caspita ? this is meeting
one's old acquaintances all in a heap ! It now
only needs to encounter cicero, and the party
will be complete ! Well, I may live in hope
to see him too, sometime ; and won't there bea
reckoning when we're altogether again T

He was about to pass on, when a clattering

of hoofs were heard behind, in the direction
of the pueblo, as if horsemen were issuing
out of it. Shortly after, a dark clump) was
seen rounding the corner, and coming on
aloof the white ribband of road. The sabres
clanking against stirrup-irons proclaimed ita
cavalry troop.

Like a tarantula retreating to its tree-cave,
the dwarf darted in under the cliff, there
crouching down — so close to Jose that the
latter could have almost touched him with
the tips of his fingers. He had no desire
to do so, no thought of it ; but the very
opposite. His wish was to avoid an encounter
; and good reason for it, as he was
soon after made aware. Fortunately for him,
the hunchback neither saw nor had a suspicion
of his proximity. With face turned to the
road, he was altogether occupied with the
party approaching.

The Hussars turned out — an escort of some
eight or ten files, with two officers at its head,
these riding side by side and a little in
advance. They were chatting gaily and
rather vociferously ; the voice of him who
spoke loudest being well known to Jose.
For Colonel Santander, whether welcome or
not, was a frequent visitor at the casa de
campo of Don Ignacio Yalverde. And the
dwarf now remembered it too, as he did so
abandoning all attempt at concealment and
gliding out into the middle of the road.

'' Carajo!'' simultaneously shouted the two
officers, as their horses reared up, snorting at
the strange shape so suddenly presented before
them. " What the Demon is it, if not Satan
himself ? " added Santander.

No, Senor Cornell returned Zorillo.
Not the devil ; only a poor creature whom
God has cursed by making him in a shape

that isn't altogether fashionable. But just
for that reason I trust being recalled to your
Excellency's remembrance — am I not '? "

Ah ! You were in the Acordada ? "

^' Si, Senor Coronet

*rand 'twas you I saw coupled to the
Tejano ? "

'* The same, Seiior. In that prosecuted by
a like ill no doubt, the devil all the time
directing it."

But where have you been, since, sirrah ? "

Ah 1 Excellence ! that's just it ; the very
thing I want to tell you. I was on my way
to the city in hopes of obtaining an interview
with you. What a bit of fortune you passing
here ; 'twill save me a journey I was ill able
to make ; for I'm quite worn out, and weak,
from being starved up there in the mountains."

Oh ! you've been up there ? "

Yes, Seiior Coronel, in hiding with the

others. But not like them voluntarily.
They took me along with them, whether I
would or no, and have kept me ever since —
till this night, when an opportunity offered
for giving them the slip. It isn't all of
four hours since I parted company with them.
But if your Excellency wishes to hear the
whole story, perhaps you'd like it better in
private. If I mistake not, some of it should
only reach your own ears."

Santander had been already thinking of
this, and turning to the officer by his side,
he said :

Take the men on, Eamirez. Halt at a
hundred yards or so, and wait for me."

In obedience to the order the escort moved
on, stopping as directed, the dialogue between
Santander and the dwarf meanwhile continuing.
It was more of a monologue, the
latter giving a detailed relation of all that

had occurred to him since the time of their
escape from the chain-gang, with comments
and suggestions added.

After hearing all, Santander rose in his
stirrups, his features showing triumph, such
as Satan might feel at a world of souls just
delivered to him.

The game is mine at last ! " he muttered
to himself, " every trick of it. They're ina
trap now ; and when they go out of it,
'twill be to the garrotaJ'

For a moment he sat silent, apparently
considering what was his best course to
pursue. Then, seemingly having decided, he
call out —

Eamirez ! Send a couple of men to me —
the corporal and another."

These, detached from the escort, came
trotting back along the road.

Here, cato ! Take charge of this curious
3—7

specimen. Keep him here, and see that you
hold him safe till you have my orders for
releasing him. Don't stray from this spot
as you value your own neck — not an inch."

Saying which he put spurs to his horse,
and rejoined his escort. Then commanding,
Forward ! at the double quick ! " they
started off at full gallop towards the city.

A Grumbling Guard.

ART of the dialogue between Santander
and the hunchback was
overheard by Jose ; enough of it
to give him the trembles. Among its revelations
was nought relating to himself, or his
connivance at the escape of the prisoners.
For all, he could see that he was now in as
much danger as they who were in hiding.
The Colonel of Hussars had gone on to the

city, perhaps to complete some duty already
engaging tim, but as likely to obtain a
stronger force. And as his words told, he
would return again ; and no doubt make
direct for the old monastery, the dwarf guiding
him.

The first thought of the faithful cicero
was not about himself, nor his horses. These
might stay in the meadow all night as they
were now likely to do. The lives of men
were at stake — his own among the number —
and his sole purpose now was to get home,
report what he had heard to his young mistress
and the Condesa ; then hasten up the
mountain to warn the imperilled ones. As
good luck would have it, he knew the place
they were in. Son of a carhonero, when a
boy he had helped his father in the charcoal
burning business ; was familiar with the
mountain forests, and their paths, and had

more than once been at the abandoned
monastery. He could easily find the way
to it. But the difficulty was to get back to
his master's house — even stir from the spot
on which he stood. Soon as receiving their
orders the two hussars had dismounted, and
tied up their horses, one on each side of the
rocky embayment ; they themselves, with
their curious charge, occupying the space between.
It was not possible to pass without
being seen by them, and as surely seized.

So long as he kept his place he might feel
comparatively safe. The cove was of a three-cornered
shape, with luckily a deep dark cleft
at its inner angle, into which he had already
squeezed himself. While the moon remained
low, and the cliff made shadow, there was
little likelihood of their seeing him unless
they came close up. Still the situation was
aught but pleasant, and ere long became

irksome in the extreme ; the conversation
to which he was compelled to listen making
it so.

The two lustres did not seem to be in the
best of temper ; the corporal more especially
showing signs of dissatisfaction. Groping
about for a stone to seat himself on, he
grumbled out : —

'' Madeira! What a bore, having to stay-here
till they get back. Heaven knows
when that will be. Like enough not before
morning. I thought we were going to pass
the night in San Augustin, and had hopes
of a chat with that muchachita at the house
where the colonel visits."

Pepita, you mean — lady's maid to the
Dona Luisa Yalverde ? "

Of course, I mean her, the pretty dear :
and have reason to think she is a bit sweet
upon me."

Jose's heart was on fire — Ms blood boiling.
It was with difficulty he restrained himself
from springing out upon the soldier and
clutching him by the throat. He succeeded,
however, in keeping his place, if not his
temper ; for it would have been sheer madness
to show himself there and then. What came
after quite tranquillised him.

Well, ahoy' returned he of the rank and
file, seemingly without fear of speaking plain
to the non-commissioned officer. " I should
be sorry to dash your hopes ; but as a friend
I can't help saying, I don't think you have
much chance in that quarter. She's a step
higher, that same Pepita ; holds her head far
above any of us common soldiers "

Common soldiers ! I'm a corporal ; you
forget that, honore. But why do you think
my chances are so poor ? "

"Because I've heard say there's a man

about the establishment to whom she's already
given what heart she may have had to give —
that they're engaged. The fellow's groom or
cicero, or something of the sort."

Jose breathed easier now, noways provoked
at having been spoken of as a " fellow ".

Bah ! " contemptuously exclaimed the
corporal. " AYhat care I for that horse-cleaner
and carriage-washer for a rival ! I've
cut out scores of such before now, and will
do the same with him. Lie down there, you
devil's imp ! " he added, turning savagely
upon the dwarf, and venting his spleen by
giving the creature a kick. "Down, or I'll
break every bone in your body."

Mercy, master ! " expostulated the hunchback.
" Don't be so cruel to a fellow creature."

"Fellow-creature. That's good, ha — ha —
ha ! " and the brute broke into a hoarse laugh,
till the rocks echoed his fiendish machinations.

"Well, your worship," rejoined he thus
inhumanly mocked, with an air of assumed
meekness; "whatever I am, it pains me to
think I should be the cause of keeping you
here. But why should you stay, may 1 ask ?
You don't suppose I'm going to run away ?
If I were with you as a prisoner ; but I am
not. I sought an interview with your Colonel
of my OT\Ti free will. Surely you saw that ! ''

"True enough, he did," interposed the
soldier.

And what if he did," growled the corporal.

Only, Senor, to show that I have no
intention to part company with you, nor
wish neither. Por Dios ! don't let me
hinder you from having that chat sith
the muchacldta. It's but a step back to
the inieclo, and like as not she'll be on the
look out for you, spite of what your comrade
says. Maybe he has an eye to the pretty

dear himself, and that's why he wishes to
discourage you."

As this rigmarole was delivered in the
most comical manner, it put the soldiers ina
better humour, both breaking out into
laughter.

Of course the corporal had no thought of
availing himself of the permission so
accorded. Their orders were strict to stay
in that spot, and stay they must. The
question was how were they to spend the time.

A smoke to begin with ; and they drew
out their cigarettes, with flint, steel, and
tinder.

Soon as the red coal appeared beneath
their noses, said the cato to his comrade :

By the way, Perico, have you your cards
with you ? "

"Did you ever know me to be without
them?"

How lucky ! I quite forgot mine."

That's because your mind was bent upon
Pepita. I saw you giving your moustache
an extra twist this evening."

Ob ! bother Pepita. Let's have an alhur
of monte."

How about light ? "

"The moon's clear enough, if it was'nt
we could manage nth our cigars. Many's
the game I've played that way."

"All right! But the stakes? I haven't
a cuartilla — nay not so much as a claro."

Carrara ! Nor I either. I spent the
last on a drink just before we got into the
saddle. It's bad ; but we can bet upon the
credit system, and use cartridges for counters,
Ah, stay ! "

At which he turned his eyes upon the dwarf,
Tvith a look of peculiar significance, cupidity
the prevailing expression.

The latter saw it with a heaviness of heart,
and a shuddering throughout his frame. All
the time apprehensive about the plunder with
which his pockets were crammed, he instinctively
anticipated what was coming.

A Dance's Showed.

OW, I shouldn't wonder," continued
the corporal, shifting upon his
seat, and facing fully round to
the dwarf ; " I shouldn't at all wonder but
that this diminutive gentleman has some
spare cash upon him ; and maybe he'll oblige
us by a little loan, considering the occasion.
What say you, Senor Enano ? "

I haven't any," was the ready answer.
And sorry to say it too — that I am."

** It don't look much like lie has," observed
Perico, with a glance at the hunchback's tattered
habiliments.

Looks are not always to be relied on,"
persisted the corporal. " Who'd ever suspecta
pearl inside an ugly oyster-shell ? "

I haven't, indeed, Senor Caho,'' once
more protested the dwarf with earnest emphasis.
*' If I had, you'd be welcome to the
loan you speak of. No man likes a game of
monte better than myself Alas ! so far from
being in funds, I'm too like your worships —
without a claro. I've been stripped of everything
; and, if you knew my story, you'd pity
me, I'm sure."

What story ? " demanded the cato becoming
curious.

"Why, that I've been robbed of aU the
money I had. It wasn't much to be sure,
only two pesetas and a real, but still that

was better than empty pockets. It happened
about half-an-hour ago. I was on my way
to San Augustin, thinking I'd there get some
supper, with a night's lodging ; when not far
from this, two men — footpads I suppose they
were — rushed out from the roadside, and
made straight at me. One took the right,
the other left. But I've good long arms, as
you see, pretty strong too ; and so I was able
to keep them off for a while. Several times
they caught hold of my wrists ; but I succeeded
in jerking them free again. I believe
I could have wrestled them both, but that
one getting angry, pulled out a long-bladed
knife, and threatened to cut my throat with it.
Pot dios ! I had to surrender then, seeing
he was in earnest."

smile giving this somewhat proHx account
of an altogether imaginary adventure, he had
started to his feet, and accompanied his

speech, with a series of pantomimic gestures ;
dancing and flinging his arms about, as he
professed to have done while defending himself
against the footpads. The grotesqueness
of the performance, though seen only in the
dim light — for he kept under the shadow —
set his listeners to laughing. Little dreamt
they why he was treating them to the spectacle,
or how cleverly he was outwitting them.
But there was a third spectator of the scene,
unknown to all of them, who was aware of it.
The cicero could not at first tell what were
the things striking him in the pit of the
stomach, as if he was being pelted with
pebbles ! But he could see they came from
the hands of the hunchback, flung behind in
his repeated contortions and gesticulations.
Moreover, that they glistened while passing
through the air, and looked whitish where
they lay, after falling at his own feet.

AVell ; what did they do to you then T
asked the corporal when he and his comrade
had finished their gufi'aw. " Stripped you
clean, as you've said T

Ay, Dios ! Just that, Senor. Took
everything I had except the rags I wear ; and
to them I might well have made them welcome."


Now, are you sure they took everything T
questioned the other, still suspicious. The
earnestness of the dwarfs affirmation made
him so.

Of course, Senor. Quite sure. I'll swear
to it, if you like."

Oh, there's no need for the formality of an
oath. Simpler to search you ! and more satisfactory.
Draw up here in front of me !"

The hunchback obeyed with an air of confident
alacrity. He had no reluctance to being
searched now, knowing his pockets were
3—8

empty. Of which the searcher satisfied himself
by groping about among the rags, and
sounding every receptacle where coin might
be kept.

But if he found no money, an article turned
up, which no little surprised himself and his
comrade — a stiletto !

Caspita r he exclaimed, as his hand
touched something hard in the waistband of
the dwarf's breeches, stuck behind his back.
What have we here ? As I live a dagger !"
drawing it out and holding it to the light.
Silver hilted, too ! Yes ; its silver, sure ; and
blade beautifully chased — worth a dohlone at
the very least !"

Half mine," interrupted Perico, putting in
his claim.

All right, camardo. We'll settle that by-and-bye.
Now, you limb of Satan !" he
continued to the hunchback, " you told us the

footpads had stripped you clean. How do you
explain this ?"

Easily enough, your worship. They only
thought of trying in my pockets, and the
stiletto being there behind where you've found
it, luckily they overlooked it."

"Oh ! indeed ;" doubtingly rejoined the
corporal ; " and pray how did you become
possessed of it, Senor Enano ! A dagger
worth a dohlone isn't a likely thing for such as
you to be owner of — that is, in an honest way.

I admit, your worship, it isn't likely.
For all, I came honestly by the article. It's
an heirloom in our family ; belonged to
my great-great-grandfather, and's descended
through several generations. For know,
Senor, my ancestors were not deformed like
poor me. Some of them were gallant soldiers,
as yourself. Indeed, one of them rose
to the rank of sergeant — that was my mother's

grandfather ; but this dagger didn't comedown
from him, being left in the main
line."

Well," laughingly returned the corporal,
after listening to the quaint chapter of explanations,
" the future herald of our family
won't have to trace it beyond yourself.
Youre now under our protection, and have
no need to warlike weapons. So we, your
protectors, will take the liberty of appropriating
the historical toy. Get out the
cards, Perico ! Let us see whether it is to
be yours or mine."

'may hiieno!'' responded Perico. "How
will you have the game ? A single alhiir
or two out of three ? "

Well, as we've only the one stake, and
no end of time for winning and loosing it,
we'd better make it the long game."

All rif^ht — come on ! I have the cards

spread — sofa y hallo. How sweet the
Queen's face looks in the moonlight ! Ah !
she's smiling at me, I know, as good as to
say — ' Worthy Perico, that silver-handled
weapon, your corporal tells you is worth all
of an onza, will ere long be thine '."

Well, lay on the Queen if you like. I'll
go the Jack, with all his grinning. Now
shuffle, and deal off."

By this the two had seated themselves,
vis-a-vis, just outside the verge where met
moonlight and shadow, a suite of cards
turned face up between them, the dealing
pack in the hands of Perico. The hunchback,
on his knees, with neck craned out,
was a spectator ; but one whose thoughts
were not with his eyes. Instead, dwelling
upon the valuables he had so cunningly
chucked back, making the mental calculation
as to how much they might be damaged by

breakage, but caring less for that than the
danger of their also becoming stakes in that
game of monte. Could he have known what
was going on behind, he would possibly have
preferred it so.

The unseen spectator, though silent, was not
inactive ; but the reverse. From the moment
of seeing himself shut up, — as it were, in a
penn — he had given all his thoughts to how
he might escape out of it. It needed none to
tell him there was no chance forwards by
the road. A rush he might make past the two
soldiers, risking seizure, and surely having the
bullets of their carbines sent after him. But
even though he got off in that way, what
would be the upshot ? The hunchback would
be certain to recognise him, remembering all.
Knowing, too, that his dialogue with the
Hussar colonel must have been overheard, he
would hasten the very event which he, Jose,

was now all anxious to provide against. The
word of warning meant for those now so much
needing it might reach them too late.

All these thoughts had passed through the
cochero^s mind before the card-playing commenced.
More, too, for he had carefully
inspected the cliff overhead, so far as the light
would allow, aided by groping. To his joy he
had discovered that there was a possibility of
scaling it. A sharp pinnacle of rock was
within reach of the swing of his halters ; and
skilled in the use of the last, over this he had
succeeded in flinging the headstall of one,
hooking it fast. It but remained to swarm up
the rope : and he was watching for an opportunity,
when glittering golden things, like a
Dance's shower, came raining against his ribs,
to fall at his feet.

He saw no reason for these being left to lie
there, but a good one against it ; so, stooping

cautiously forward, he gathered up all, stowing
them away in his pockets. Then turning and
taking hold of the halter, with as little noise
as possible, he hoisted himself up to the crest
of the cliff.

The soldiers engrossed with their game, and
the dwarf, though but a spectator, having also
become interested in it — none of the three
either saw or heard him. And the last he
heard of them as he stole silently away, was
the corporal delightedly calling out,

Sola en la ijuerta, modo ! The dagger's
mine, darling Perico 1"

A SERIES OF Surprises.

HE cicero had but a confused idea of
what he was carrying away with
him. By the feel, watches, with
chains and bracelets ; besides some smaller
articles wrapped in bits of papers. The uncertainty
of his getting safe up the cliff hindered
him from giving them even the most cursory
examination, nor did he think of doing; this
till at sufficient distance from the card-playing

party to feel sure lie was beyond danger of
pursuit. Then the temptation to have a look
at the things, which had so strangely and unexpectedly
come into his possession, became
irresistible ; and sitting down upon a ledge of
rock, he drew them out into the light of the
moon. Two watches there were, both gold,
and one with a jewelled case.

Car red / " he exclaimed, as his eyes fell
upon the latter, and became fixed in a stare of
blank amazement ; " Can it be ! It is — the
Condesa's watch — the very one she would
have given me ! But how came the hunchback
to have it 1 Surely he must have stolen
it. The other, too, with all these things !"

He looked at the second watch, but as it
had never been in his hands before, he was
unable to identify it. Still it resembled one
he had seen his mistress wearing, and most
likely was the same.

The bracelets, chains, reckless, and brooches
would be theirs, too ; as also the rings and
other bijouterie, which the dwarf had found
time to do up in paper.

Stolen them ? " continued the cocker o,
interrogatively, as he ran his eyes over the
varied assortment.

How could he ? The watches he might,
but the other things. Why bless me, here
are two pairs of earrings — and these grand
pendants — I'm sure I saw them in the ears
of the Condesa this very day. He couldn't
have taken them without her knowing it.
Santo Bios! How ever has he come by
them ? "

As he thus questioned and reflected, a
feeling of apprehension began to creep over
him. A little before leaving the house to
go after his horses he had observed his young
mistress and the Condesa going into the

ornamental grounds. And they went alone ;
Don Ignacio having repaired to a private
apartment, where he was accustomed to shut
himself up for the examination of State papers,
what if the ladies were still in the grounds,
in some secluded spot, lying dead, where all
these adornments had been stripped from
their persons !

This horrible tableau did the faithful servant
in imagination conjure up. He could not
help it. Nor was the thing so very
improbable. He had some earlier acquaintance
with the desperate character of the
dwarf, which later experience confirmed.
Besides, there was the state of the country —
thieves and robbers all round — men who
made lioiit of murder !

"With a heaviness of heart — a painful fear
that there had been murder — he stayed not
to further examine the trinkets ; but gathering

all up again, and thrusting them back into
his pocket, hurried on home.

And when home he went not to his own
quarters in the coachyard, but straight into
the ^jaffo — the private court of the house.
There he encountered Pepita ; soon as he
set eyes on her, asking —

Where are the Senoritas ? "

'' What's that to you ? " saucily retorted
the maid.

Nothing, if I only knew they were safe."

Safe ! Why what's the man thinking —
talking about ? Have you lost your senses,
honore f "

^^o, Pepita. But the ladies have lost
something. Look here ! "

He had plunged both hands into his
pockets, and drawn them out again full of
things that scintillated in the moonlight —
watches and jewellery of different kinds, as

she saw. With a woman's curiosity, gliding
swiftly forward to examine them, she recognised
every article at a glance, amazement
overspreading her countenance, as it lately
had his.

y4 de mi ./ " she exclaimed, no longer in
jesting tone. " What does it all mean,
Jose ? "

Just what I want to know myself, and
why I am asking after the Senoritas. But
where are they ? "

In the garden, or the grounds somewhere.
They strolled out about an hour
ao[o, and haven't been in since."

Pray God, they're still alive ! Come
with me, Pepita. Let us look for them. I
have terrible fears."

So appealed to, the girl gave ready assent
; and side by side they hastened towards
the rear of the house, behind which were the

ornamental grounds extending backwards.
But they had not far to go before hearing
sounds that set their minds at rest, removing;
all anxiety — the voices of the ladies themselves.
They were not only alive, but
laughing !

To Jose and Pepita this seemed strange as
anything else — a perfect mystery. Merry
after parting with all those pretty things ;
costly, too — worth hundreds of Dolores I
Withal, they were so ; their lightness of
heart due to the knowledge thus gained,
that their own lovers were still living and
safe ; and something of merriment, added
by that odd encounter with the enano, of
which they were yet conversing.

If their behaviour mystified their servants,
not less were they themselves puzzled, when
Jose presented himself before them with
hands held out, saying :

I ask your pardon for intruding, but
don't these belong to your ladyships ? "

They saw their watches and other effects
obtained from them by "false pretences,"
as they were now to learn.

The revelation that succeeded put an end
to their joyous humour ; their hearts that
had been light for a moment were now
becoming heavier than ever. The treachery
of the hunchback and his intentions were
manifest. He meant to guide Santander and
his soldiers to the old monastery where they
would take the patriots by surprise.

What is to be done, Ysabel ? " despairingly
asked the Donna Luisa. 'how can
we give them warning ? "

To which the cicero, not the Countess
made answer, saying :

I can do that, SenoritaJ'

His confident tone reassured them ; more

still his making known the design lie had
already conceived, and his ability to execute
it. He was acquainted with the old convent
and the paths leading to it — every inch of
them.

It needed not their united appeal to urge
him to immediate departure. He was off the
instant after, and long before the clock of
Talpam had struck the midnight hour well
up the mountain road with eyes looking to
the right, in the direction of the Cerro Ajusgo.

3—9

MONKS NO More.

IHE surmise which had influenced
Zorillo to leaving the convent cell
earlier than he intended was a
correct one. The goings on in the Refectory
were, at the time, of an unusual kind — a
grand occasion, as he had worded it. There
were some fifty men in it ; but not one of
them now affecting either the garb or the
behaviour of the monk. Soldiers all ; or

at least in warlike guise ; a few wearing
regular though undress uniforms, but the
majority habited as " guerilleros," in the
picturesque costumes of their country. They
were booted, and belted, swords by their
sides, with pistols in holsters hanging against
the walls, and spurs ready for buckling on.
Standing in corners were stacks of carbines,
and lances freshly pennoned, with their blades
bright from being recently sharpened — a
panoply which spoke of fighting ere long
expected to take place.

It may be asked, where were their horses,
since all the arms and accoutrements seen
around were those of cavalry ? But horses
they had, though not there. Each knew
where to lay hands on his own, far or near,
stalled in the stable of some sequestered
rancho, or it might be mountain cavern.
They were not yet assembled to hearken to

the call of '' Boot and Saddle ". That they
would hear at a later hour, and in a different
place.

The occasion of their being in such guise
and together, was because it was to be the
last night of their sojourn in the monastery.
And they were making it a merry one ; the
Refectory table was being loaded with the
best that was left to them in meats and
drinks. Upon it were what bottles remained
of those famous wines from the bins of the
rich hacienda — his forced contribution —
and they were fast getting emptied. From
the way the convives were quaffing, it was
not likely that any of the Burgundy, Madeira,
or Pedro Ximenes would be left behind — not
even a " heel-tap ".

It had got to be midnight, and they were
still in the midst of the revelry, when Eivas,
who headed the table, rose to his feet, in

that formal manner which tells of speech to
be made or toast proclaimed.

Cataracts ! " he said, as soon as the buzz
of conversation had ended, " As you're aware,
we part from this place to-night ; and some
of you know whither we are going, and for
what purpose. But not all ; therefore I deem
it my duty to tell you. You saw a courier
who came up early this morning — bringing
good news, I'm glad to say. This despatch
I hold in my hand is from an old friend.
General Alvarez; who, though he may not
boast sangre-acid in his veins, is as brave
a soldier, and pure a patriot, as any in the
land. You know that. He tells me his
Pints are ready for a rising, and only wait
for us — the '' Free Lances " — with some others
he has summoned to join him in giving the
grit. By his messenger I have sent answer
that we, too, are ready, and will respond to

his summons. ' You all approve of that, I
take it 1 "

All ! " was the exclaim in chorus, without
a dissenting voice.

Moreover," proceeded the speaker, " I've
told the General we'll be on the march tomorrow
morning, and can meet him at a
place he has mentioned the day after. His
plan is to attack the town of Oaxaca ; and, if
we succeed in taking it, then we move direct
on the capital.

Now, cataracts ; I've nothing more to
say ; only that you're to scatter after your
horses, and lose no time in mustering
again — the old rendezvous, this side La
Guard."

So ended the speech of the Free Lances'
leader, but despite the suggestions of immediate
departure, the circle around the table
did not instantly break up.

The bottles were not all empty as yet,
nor the revellers satisfied to leave them till
they should be so. Besides, there was no
particular need of haste for another hour
or two. So they stuck to the table, smoking,
drinking, and toasting many things, as persons,
among the latter their lately joined allies
the Iiiandes and Tejano, about whose
proved valour on other fields, of which they
had heard, the Free Lances were enthusiastically
eloquent.

Kearney, speaking in their own tongue,
made appropriate response ; while Rock,
when told he had been toasted, delivered
himself in characteristic strain, saying : —

'' Feller-citizens, — For since I tuk up yur
cause, I reckon you'll give me leave to call ye
so — it air a glad thing to this chile to think
he'll soon lev a bit o' fighting'. An 'specially
as its to be again ole Santy, the turned

skunk. By the jumping' Geehosofat ! if Oris
Rock ever gits alongside him again, as he war
on't San Dainty, there want be no more
mercy for the cussed tyrant, same as, like
a set of fools, we Texans showed him thar
an' then. Tell them what I saved. Cap."

With which abrupt wind-up he dropped
back upon his seat, gulping down a tumblerful
of best Madeira, as though it were
table-beer.

Kearney did tell them, translating his
comrade's speech faithfully as the patois
would permit ; which heightened their enthusiasm,
many of them starting to their
feet, rushing round the table, and, Mexican
fashion, enfolding the Tejano in friendly
embrace.

The hugging at an end, there was yet
another toast to follow, the same which always
wound up the festivals of the " Free

Lances," whatever the occasion. Their leader,
as often before, now again pronounced it —

Patria y Libertas ! "

And never before did it have more enthusiastic
reception, the cheer that rang through
the old convent, louder than any laughter
of monks who may have ever made it their
home.

Ere it had ceased reverberating, the door
of the refectory was suddenly pushed open,
and a man rushed into the room, as he
entered, crying out —

Traicioii ! "

Treason ! " echoed fifty voices as one,
all again starting to their feet, and turning
faces toward the alarmist. The mayor-domo
it was, who, as the other mozos, was half
equipped for a journey.

What mean you, Gregorio ? " demanded
his master.

There's one can tell you better than I,
Don Euperto."

Who ? Where is he 1 "

Outside, Senor. A messenger who has
just come u^^ — he's from San Augustin."

But how has he passed our sentry."

*' Ah ! capitan ; I'd rather he told you
himself."

Mysterious speech on the part of the
mayor-domo, which heightened the apprehension
of those hearing it.

Call him hither ! " commanded Eivas.

No calling was needed ; the person spoken
of being in the environ close by ; and
Gregorio, again opening the door, drew him
inside.

The cicero ! mentally exclaimed Eivas,
Kearney, and the Texan, soon as setting eyes
on him.

The cicero it was, Jose, though they

knew not his name nor anything more of
him than what they had learned in that note
of the Condesa s saying that he could be
trusted, and their brief association with
him afterwards — which gave them proof that
he could.

As he presented himself inside the room he
seemed panting for breath, and really was
He had only just arrived up the steep climb,
and exchanged hardly half a dozen words
with the mayor-domo, who had met him
at the outside entrance.

Announced as a messenger, neither the
Captain of the Free Lances nor Florence
Kearney needed telling who sent him.
A sweet intuition told them that. Eivas
but asked,

How have you found the way up here ? "

Por Dios ! Senor, I've been here before —
many's the time. I was born among these

mountains — am well acquainted with all the
paths everywhere around."

But the sentry below. How did you get
past him ? You haven't the countersign ! "

He wouldn't have heard it if I had, Senor.
Pore ! he'll never hear countersign again —
nor anything else."

Why ? Explain yourself ! "

Esta puerto ! He's lies at the bottom
of the cliff his body crushed — "

Who has done it ? Who's betrayed us ? "
interrupted a volley of voices.

"The hunchback, Zorillo," answered Jos,
to the astonishment of all. For in the
dialogue between the dwarf and Santander,
he had heard enough to anticipate the ghastly
spectacle awaiting him on his way up the
mountain.

Cries of anger and vengeance were simultaneously
sent up ; all showing eager to rush

from the room. They but waited for a word
more.

Eivas, however, suspecting that the messenger
meant that word for himself, claimed
their indulgence, and led him outside, inviting
Kearney to accompany them.

Though covering much ground, and relating to
many incidents, the cocheros story was quickly
told. Not in the exact order of occurrence,
but as questioned by his impatient listeners.
He ran rapidly over all that happened, since
their parting at the corner of the Coyoacan
road, the latter events most interesting them.
Surprised were they to hear that Don Ignacio
and his daughter for some time had been
staying at San Augustin — the Condesa with
them. Had they but known that before,
in all probability things would not have been
as now. Possibly they might have been
worse ; though, even as they stood, there was

enough danger impending over all. As for
themselves, both Mexican and Irishman, less
recked of it, as they thought of how they were
being warned, and by whom. That of itself
was recompense for all their perils.

Meanwhile, those left inside the room were
chafing to learn the particulars of the treason,
though they were not all there now. Some
had sallied out, and gone down the cliff to
bring up the body of their murdered comrade ;
others, the mayor-domo conducting, back to
the place where the hunchback should be, but
was not. There to find confirmation of what
had been said. The cell untenanted ; the window
bar filed through and broken ; the file
lying by it, and the chain hanging down
outside.

Intelligible to them now was the tale of
treason, without their hearing it told.

When once more they assembled in the

Refectory, it was with chastened, saddened
hearts. For they had come from digging a
grave, and lowering into it a corpse. Again
gathered around the table they drank the
stirrup-cup, as was their wont, but never so
joylessly, or with such stinted acclaim.

ONLY EMPTY Bottles'

BOUT the time the Free Lances
were burying their comrade in the
cemetery of the convent, the gate
of San Antonio de Bad was opened to
permit the passage of a squadron of Hussars
going outward from the city. There were
nigh 200 of them, in formation *' by fours "
the wide causeway allowing ample room
for even ten abreast.

At their head rode Colonel Santander,
with Major Eamirez by his side, other officers
in their places distributed along the line.

Soon as they had cleared the garita, a
word to the bugler, with a note or two
from his trumpet quick succeeding, set them
into a gallop ; the white dusty road and clear
moonlight making the fastest pace easily
attainable. And he who commanded was in
haste, his destination being that old monastery,
of which he had only lately heard,
but enough to make him most eager to reach
it before morning. His hopes were high ; at
last was he likely to make a coujj — that
capture so much desired, so long delayed !

For nearly an hour bridles were let loose,
and spurs repeatedly plied. On along the
canada swept the squadron, over the bridge
Churubusco, and past the hacienda of San
Antonio de Bad, which gives its name to
3—10

the city gate on that side. Thenceforward
the Pedregal impinges on the road, and the
Hussars still going at a gallop along its
edge, another bugle-call brought them to a
halt.

That, however, had naught to do with their
halting, which came from their commander,
having reached the spot where he had left
the hunchback in charge of the two
soldiers.

He need not hailing them to assure himself
they were still there. The trampling of
horses on the hard causeway, heard afar off,
had long ago forewarned the corporal of
what was coming ; and he was out on the
road to receive them, standing in an attitude
of attention.

The parley was brief, and quick the action
which accompanied it.

Into your saddle, cato ! " commanded the

colonel. " Take that curiosity up behind you
and bring it along."

In an instant the corporal was mounted,
the " curiosity " hoisted up to his croup
by Perico, who then sprang to the back of
his own horse. Once more the bugle gave
tongue, and away they went again.

The cavalcade made no stop in San Augustin.
There was no object for halting it there,
and delay was the thing its commander most
desired to avoid. As they went clattering
through the pueblo its people were a-bed,
seemingly asleep. But not all. Two at least
were awake, and heard that unusual noise —
listened to it with a trembling in their frames
and fear in their hearts. Two ladies they
were, inside a house beyond the village, on
the road running south. Too well knew they
what it meant, and whither the galloping
cohort was bound. And themselves unseen,

they saw who was at the head ; though they
needed not seeing him to know. But peering
through the jalousies, the moonlight
revealed to them the face of Don Carlos
Santander, in the glimpse they got of it,
showing spitefully triumphant.

He could not see them, though his eyes
interrogated the windows while he was riding
past. They had taken care to extinguish the
light in their room.

Virgin Santissima / Mother of God ! "
exclaimed one of the ladies, Luisa Yalverde,
as she dropped on her knees in prayer, " Send
that they've got safe off ere this ! "

Make your mind easy, ainiga f " counselled
the Condesa Almonte in less precatory tone.
I'm good as sure they have. Jose cannot
fail to have reached and given them warning.
That will be enough."

A mile or so beyond San Augustin the

southern road becomes too steep for horses to
go at a gallop, without risk of breaking their
wind. So there the Hussars had to change
to a slower pace — a walk in fact. There were
other reasons for coming to this. The sound
of their hoof-strokes ascending; would be
heard far up the mountain, might reach the
ears of those in the monastery, and so thwart
the surprise intended for them.

While toiling more leisurely up the steep,
any one chancing to look in the hunchback's
face would there have observed an expression
indescribable. Sadness pervaded it, with an
air of perplexity, as though he had met
with some misfortune he could not quite
comprehend.

And so had he. Before leaving the spot
where the stiletto was taken from him, he
had sought an opportunity to step back
into that shady niche in the cliff where he

had lost his treasures. The monte players,
unsuspicious of his object, made no objection.
But instead of there finding what he expected,
he saw only a pair of horse-halters : one lying
coiled upon the ground, the head-stall of
the other caught over the rock above, the
rope end dangling down !

An inexplicable phenomenon which, however,
he had kept to himself, and ever since
been cudgelling his brains to account for.

But soon after he had something else to
think of ; the time having arrived when he was
called upon to give proof of his capability
as a guide. Heretofore it had been all plain
road riding ; but now they had reached a
point spoken of by himself, where the canada
must be forsaken. The horses, too, left
behind ; everything but their weapons ; the
path beyond being barely practicable for men
afoot.

Dismounting all, at a command — this time
not given by the bugle — and leaving a
sufficient detail to look after the animals,
they commenced the ascent, their guide,
seemingly more quadruped than biped, in
the lead. Strung out in single file — no other
formation being possible — as they wound
their way up the zig-zag with the moonlight
here and there, giving back the glint
of their armour, it was as some great serpent
a monster of the antediluvian ages — crawling
towards its prey. Silently as serpent too ;
not a word spoken, nor exclamation uttered
along their line. For, although it might
be another hour before they could reach
their destination, less than a second would
suffice for their voices to get there, even
though but muttered.

One spot their guide passed with something
like a shudder. It was where he had appropriated

the dagger taken from a dead body.
His shuddering was not due to that, but to
fear from a far different cause. The body was
no longer there. Those who dwelt above
must have been down and borne it away.
They would now be on the alert, and at any
moment he might hear the cracking of carbines
— a volley ; perhaps feel the avenging
bullet ! What if they should roll rocks down
and crush him and the party behind ? In
any case there could be no surprisal now ;
and he would gladly have seen those he was
guiding give up the thought of it and turn
back. Santander was himself irresolute, and
would willingly have done so. But Eamirez,
a man of more mettle, at the ]Point of his
sword commanded the hunchback to keep
on, and the cowardly colonel dare not revoke
the order without eternally disgracing himself.


They had no danger to encounter, though
they knew not that. Neither vidette nor
sentinel was stationed there now ; and, without
challenge or obstruction, they reached
the platform on which the building stood,
the soldiers taking to right and left till they
swarmed around it as bees. But they found
no honey inside that hive.

There was a summons to surrender, which
received no response. Repeated louder, and
a carbine fired, the result was the same.
Silence inside, there could be no one T\T.thin.

Nor was there. When the Hussar colonel,
with a dozen of his men, at length screwed
up courage to make a burst into the doorway,
and on to the refectory, they saw but the
evidence of late occupancy in the fragments
of a supper, with some dozens of wine bottles
down among the dead men," empty as the
buildings itself.

Disappointed as were the soldiers at finding
them so, but still more their commanding
officer at his hated enemies having again
got away from him. His soul was brimful
of chagrin, nor did it allay the feeling to
learn how, when a path was pointed out to
him leading down the other side, they must
have made off. And along such a path
pursuit was idle. No one could say where
it led — like enough to a trap.

He was not the only one of the party who
felt disappointed at the failure of the expedition.
Its guide had reason to be chagrined,
too, in his own way of thinking, much more
than the leader himself. For not only had he
lost the goods obtained under false pretences,
but the hope of reward for his volunteered
services.

Still the dwarf was not so down in the
mouth. He had another arrow in his quiver

—kept in reserve for reasons of his o^^ti —
a shaft from which he expected more profit
than all yet sjDcnt. And as the Hussar colonel
was swearing and raising around, he saw his
opportunity to discharge it. With half a
dozen whispered words he tranquillised the
latter ; after which there was a brief conference
between the two, its effect upon Santander
showing itself in his countenance, that
became all agieam, lit up with a satisfied but
malignant joy.

When, in an hour after, they were again
in their saddles riding in return for the City,
a snatch of dialogue between Santander and
Eamirez gave indication of what so gratified
the colonel of Hussars.

Well, Major," he said " we've done road
enough for this day. You'll be wanting rest
by the time you get to quarters."

That's true enough. Colonel. Twice to

San Augustin and back, with the additional
mileage up the mountains — twenty leagues, I
take it — to say nothing of the climbing."

"All of twenty leagues it will be, when
we've done with it. But our ride won't be
over then. If I'm not mistaken, we'll be
back this way before we lay side on a bed.
There's another nest not far off will claim a
visit from us, one we're not likely to find so
empty. I'd rob it now if I had my way ;
but, for certain reasons, mus'nt without
permit from Head Quarters ; the which I'm
sure of getting ! Carajo ! if the cock birds
have escaped, I'll take care the hens don't."

And as if to make sure of it he dug the
spurs deep into the flanks of his now jaded
charger, again commanding the " quick
gallop".

A DAY OF SUSPENSE.

AWN was just beginning to show
over the eastern Cordilleras, its
aurora giving a rose tint to the
snowy cone of Popocatepec, as the Hussars
passed back through San Augustin. The bells
of the paroq^ida had commenced tolling matins
and many people abroad in the streets, hurrying
toward the church, saw them — interrogating
one another, as to where they had been,
and on what errand bound.

But before entering the pueblo, they had to
pass under the same eyes that observed them
going outward on the other side ; these more
keenly and anxiously scrutinising them now,
noting every file as it came in sight, every
individual horseman, till the last was revealed;
then lighting up with joyous sparkle, while
they thus observing, breathed freely.

For the soldiers had come as they went ; nota
man added to their number, if none missing;
but certainly no prisoners brought back !

They've got safe off," triumphantly exclaimed
the Countess, when the rearmost files
had forged past, " as I told you they would ;
I knew there was no fear after they had been
warned."

That they had been warned both were by
this aware ; their messenger having meanwhile
returned and reported to that effect. He had
met the Hussars on their way up ; but crouching

among some bushes, he had been unobserved
by them ; and, soon as they were well
out of the way, slipped out again and made all
haste home.

He had brought back something more thana
mere verbal message — a hilletita for each of
the two who had commissioned him.

The notes were alike, in that both had been
hastily scribbled, and in brief but warm expression
of thanks for the service done to the
writers. Beyond this, however, they were
quite different. It was the first epistle
Florence Kearney had ever indited to Louisa
Valverde, and ran in fervid strain. He felt he
could so address her. With love long in doubt
that it was even reciprocated, but sure of its
being so now, he spoke frankly, as passionately.
Whatever his future, she had his heart,
and wholly. If he lived he would seek her
again at the peril of a thousand lives ; if it

should be his fate to die, her name would bethe
last word on his lips.

Virgin Santissima ! Keep him safe ! "
was her prayer, as she finished devouring
the sweet words ; then, refolding the sheet
on which they were written, secreted it away
in the bosom of her dress — a treasure more
esteemed than aught that had ever lain
there.

The communication received by the Con-des
was less effusive, and more to the point
of what, under present circumstances, concerned
the writer — as, indeed, all of them.
Don Rupert wrote with the confidence of
a lover who had never known doubt. A man
of rare qualities, he was true to friendship
as to his country's cause, and would not be
false to love. And he had no fear of her.
His liens with Ysabel Almonte were such as
to preclude all thought of her affections ever

cliaiio;mo^. He knew that she was hie —
heart, soul, everything. For had she not
given him every earnest of it — befriended
him throno^h weal and throng-h woe ? Nor

o o

had he need to assure her that her love was
reciprocated, or his fealty still unfaltering ;
for their faith, as their reliance, was mutual.
His letter, therefore, was less that of a lover
to his mistress, than one between man and
man, written to a fellow-conspirator ; most
of it in figurative phrase, even some of it
in cypher I

No surprise to her all that ; she understood
the reason. Nor was there any enigma
in the signs and words of double signification
; without difficulty she interpreted
them all.

They told her of the anticipated rising,
with the attempt to be made on Oaxaca ;
the hopes of its having a success ; and, if so,
3—11

what would come after. But also of something
before this where he, the writer, and
his Free Lances would be on the following
night, so that if need arose she could communicate
with him. If she had apprehension
of danger to him, he was not without
thought of the same threatening herself, and
her friend too.

Neither where they now ; instead, filled
with such apprehension. In view of what
had occurred on the preceding evening, and
throughout the night, how could they be
other 1 The dwarf must know more than
he had revealed in that dialogue overheard
by Jose. In short, he seemed aware of
everything — the cicero's complicity, as their
own. The free surrender of their watches
and jewellery for the support of the escaped
prisoners were of itself enough to incriminate
them. Surely would there be another investigation,

more rigorous than before, and
likely to have a different ending.

With this in contemplation, their souls
full of fear, neither went that morning to
matins. Nor did they essay to take sleep
or rest. Instead, wandered about the house
from room to room, and out into the grounds
seemingly distraught.

They had the place all to themselves ; no
one to take counsel nth, none to comfort
them ; Don Ignacio, at an early hour, having
been called off to his duties in the city.
But they were not destined to spend the
whole of that day without seeing a visitor.
As the clocks of San Augustin were striking
8 p.m. one presented himself at the gate,
in the guise of an officer of Hussars — Don
Carlos Santander. Nor was he alone, but
with an escort accompanying. They were
seated in the verandah of the inner court,

but saw him through the saguan, the door
of which was open ; saw him enter at the
outer gate, and without dismounting come
on towards them, several files of his men
following. He had been accustomed to visit
them there, and they to receive his visits,
however reluctantly ; reasons of many kinds
compelling them. But never had he presented
himself as now. It was an act of ill-manners
his entering unannounced ; another riding
into the enclosure with soldiers behind him ;
but the rudeness was complete when he came
on into the patio still in the saddle — his
men, too — and pulled up directly in front of
them, without waiting for word of invitation.
The stiff formal bow ; the expression upon
his swarthy features, severe, but with ill-concealed
exultation in it, proclaimed his visit
of no complimentary kind.

By this both where on their feet, looking

offended — even angry — at the same time
alarmed. And yet little surprised ; for it
was only confirmation of the fear that had
been all day oppressing them — its very
fulfilment. But that they believed it this,
they would have shown their resentment by
retiring and leaving; him there. As it was,
they knew that would be idle, and so stayed
to hear what he had to say. It was —

*' Senoritas, I see you're wondering at my
thus presenting myself. Not strange you
should. Nor could anyone more regret the
disagreeable errand I've come upon than I.
It grieves me sorely, I assure you."

"What is it. Colonel Santander ? " demanded
the Countess, with sang-froid partially
restored.

"I hate to declare it, Condesa," he rejoined;
still more to execute it. But compelled
by the rigorous necessities of a soldier's duty,
I must.

Well, sir ; must what ? "

Make you a prisoner ; and, I am sorry to
add, also the Dona Luisa."

Oh, that's it ! " exclaimed the Countess,
with a scornful inclination of the head.
Well, sir, I don't wonder at your disliking
the duty, as you say you do. It seems more
that of a policeman than a soldier."

The retort struck home, still further
humiliating him in the eyes of the woman
he loved, Luisa Yalverde. But he now
knew she loved not him ; and had made
up his mind to humble her, in a way hitherto
untried. Stung by the innuendo, and
dropping his clumsy pretence at politeness,
he spitefully rejoined : —

"Thank you, Condesa Almonte, for your
amiable observation. It does something to
compensate me for having to do policeman's
duty. And now let it be done. Please to

consider yourself under arrest ; and you
also, Senorita Valverde."

Up to this time the last-named lady had
not said a word ; the distress she was in restraining
her. But as mistress there, she
saw it was her turn to speak, which she
did, saying : —

If we are your prisoners, Colonel Santander,
I hope you will not take us away
from here till my father comes home. As
you may be aware, he's in the city."

I am aware of that. Dona Luisa ; and
glad to say my orders enable me to comply
nth your wishes, and that you remain here
till Don Ignacio returns. I'm enjoined to
see to your safe keeping. A very absurd requirement,
but one which often falls to the
lot of the soldier as well as the policeman''

Neither the significant words nor the forced
laugh that accompanied them had any effect

on her for whom they were intended. "With
disdain in her eyes, such as a captive queen
might show for the common soldier who
stood guard over her, the Condesa had already
turned her back upon the speaker and was
walking away. With like proud air, but
less confident and scornful, Luisa Valverde
followed. Both were allowed to pass inside,
leaving the Hussar colonel to take such
measures for their keeping as he might
think fit.

His first step was to order in the remainder
of his escort and distribute them around the
house ; so that in ten minutes after the casa
de campo of Don Ignacio Valverde bore
resemblance to a barrack, with sentinels at
every entrance and corner 1

Under AEEEST.

jCAECE necessary to say that Luisa
Yalverde and Ysabel Almonte were
at length really alarmed — fully
alive to a sense of their danger.

It was no more a question of the safety
of their lovers, but their own. And the
prospect was dark, indeed. Santander had
said nothing of the reason for arresting them ;
nor had they cared to inquire. They divined

it ; no longer doubting that it was owing to
revelations made by the hunchback.

Sure now that this diminutive wretch not
only himself knew their secret, but had made
it known in higher quarters, there seemed
no hope for them ; instead, ruin staring them
in the face. The indignity to their persons
they were already experiencing, would be followed
by social disgrace, and confiscation of
property.

0, Ysabelita ! what will they do to us ? "
was the Dona Luisa's anxious interrogatory,
soon as they had got well inside their room.
Do you think they'll put us in a prison 1 "

'' Possibly they will. I wish there was
nothing worse awaiting us."

Worse ! Do you mean they'd inflict
punishment on us — that is, corporal punishment
? Surely they aren't ? "

Aren't ! Santa Anna dare anything —

at least, neither slime nor mercy will restrain
him. No more this other man, his minion,
whom you know better than I. But it isn't
punishment of that kind I'm thinking of."

"What then, Ysabel? The loss of our
property ? It'll be all taken from us, I
suppose."

"In aU likelihood it will," rejoined the
Condesa, with as much unconcern as though
her estates, value for more than a million,
were not worth a thought.

Oh ! my poor father ! This new misfortune,
and all owing to me. 'Twill kill him ! "

No, no, Lusita ! Don't fear that. He
will survive it, if aught survives of our
country's liberty. And it will, all of it,
be restored again. 'Tis something else I
was thinking; of."

Again the other asked " What ? " her
countenance showing increased anxiety.

What we as women have more to fear
than aught else. From the loss of lands,
houses, riches of any sort, one may recover —
from the loss of that, never ? "

Enigmatic as were the words, Luisa
Valverde needed no explanation of them ;
nor pressed for it. She comprehended all
now, and signified her apprehension by exclaiming,
with a shudder. " Virgin 
! "

The prison they will take us to," pursued
the Countess, "is a place — that in the Plaza
Grande. We shall be immured there, and at
the mercy of that man, that monster !
God !— Mother of God, protect me ! "

At which she dropped down upon a couch,
despairingly, with face buried in her hands.

It was a rare thing for the Condesa Almonte
to be so moved — rather to show despondence
and her friend was affected accordingly.

For there was another man at whose mercy
she herself would be — one like a monster,
and as she well knew equally unmerciful —
he who at that moment was under the same
roof with them — in her father's house, for
the time its master.

"But, Ysabel," she said, hoping against
hope, " surely they will not dare to "

She left the word unspoken, knowing it
was not needed to make her meaning understood.


Not dare ! " echoed the Countess,
recovering nerve and again rising to her feet.
"As I've said he'll dare anything — will Don
Antonio Lopes de Santa Anna. Besides,
what has he to fear ? Nothing. He can
show good cause for our imprisonment else
he would never have had us arrested. Enough
to satisfy any clamour of the people. And how
would any one ever know of what might be

done to us inside the Palacio ? Ah, Lusita
queries ; if its walls could speak they might
tell tales sad enough to make angels weep.
We wouldst be the first who have been subjected
to insult — ay, infamy — by Ul excellent
Vega me Dios'' she cried out
in conclusion, stamping her foot on the floor,
while the flash of her eyes told of some fixed
determination, "If it be so, that Palace
prison will have another secret to keejD, or a
tale to tell, sad and tragic as any that has
preceded. I, Ysabel Almonte, shall die in it
rather than come out dishonoured."

I, too 1 " echoed Luisa Valverde, if in
less excited manner, inspired by a like heroic
resolve.

While his fair prisoners were thus exchanging
thought and speech, Santander, in
the sola grande outside, was doing his best

to pass the time pleasantly. An effort it
was costing him, however, and one far from
successful. His last lingering hope of being
beloved by Luisa Yalverde was gone — completely
destroyed by what had late come to
his knowledge — and henceforth his love for
her could only be as that of Tarquin for
Lucretia. Nor would he have any CoUatinus
to fear — no rival, martial or otherwise — since
his master, Santa Anna, had long since given
up his designs on Don Ignacio's daughter ;
exclusively bending himself to his scheme
of conquest — now revenge — over the Condesa.
But though relieved in this regard, and likely
to have his own way, Carlos Santander was
anything but a happy man after making
that arrest ; instead, almost as miserable as
either of those he had arrested.

Still keeping up a pretence of gallantry,
he could not command their company in the

drawing-room where lie had installed himself ;
nor, under the circumstances, would it have
been desirable. He was not alone, however ;
Major Eamirez and the other officers of his
escort being there with him ; and, as in like
cases, they where enjoying themselves. However
considerate for the feelings of the ladies,
they made free enough with the house itself,
its domestics, larder, and cocina, and, above
all, the cellar. Its inns were inquired into,
the best wine ordered to be brought from
them, as though they who gave the order
were the guests of an hotel, and Don Ignacio's
drawing-room a drinking saloon.

Outside in the court-yard, and further off
by the coach-house, similar scenes were transpiring.
Never had that quiet casa de
campo known so much noise. For the
soldiers had got among them — it was the house
of a rebel and therefore devoted to ruin.

THE Cochlea DOGGED.

Must after the ladies had been proclaimed
under arrest, but before the
the sentinels were posted around
the house, a man might have been seen outside
their line, making all haste away from it.
He had need, his capture being also contemplated.
Jose it was, who, from a place of
concealment, had not only seen what passed,
but heard the conversation between Santander
3—12

and the Senoritas. The words spoken by his
young mistress, and the rejoinder received,
were all he waited for. Giving him his cue
for departure, they also gave him hopes of
something more than the saving of his own
life. That the last was endangered he knew
now — forfeited indeed, should he fall into the
hands of those who had invaded the place.
So instead of returning to the stable yard,
from which he had issued on hearing the
fracas in front, he retreated rewards, first
through the ornamental grounds, then over
the wall upon which the hunchback had
perched himself on the preceding night. Jose,
however, did not stay on it for more than a
second's time. Soon as mounting to its
summit, he slid down on the other side, and
ran along the lane in the direction of the
main road.

Before reaching this, however, a reflection

caused him to slacken pace, and then come to
a stop. It was still daylight, and there would
be a guard stationed by the front gate, sure to
see him along; the road. The oTOUDd on the
opposite side of the lane was a patch of rocky
scrub — in short a chapparal — into which in an
instant after he plunged, and when well under
cover again made stop ; this time dropping
down on his hands and knees. The attitude
gave him a better opportunity of listening ;
and listen he did — all ears.

To hear voices all around the house, loudest
in the direction of the stable yard. In tones
not of triumph, but telling of disappointment.
For in truth it was so ; the shouts of the
soldiers searching for his very self, and swearing
because he could not be found. He had
reason to congratulate himself in having got
outside the enclosure. It was now being
quartered everywhere, gardens, grounds and all.

For the time he felt comparatively safe ; but
he dared not return to the lane. And less
show himself on the open road ; as scouting
parties were sure of being sent out after him.
There was no alternative, therefore, but stay
where he was till the darkness came down.
Luckily, he would not have long to wait for it.
The sun had set, and twilight in the Mexican
valley is but a brief interval between day and
night. In a few minutes after commencement,
it is over.

Short as it was it gave him time to consider
his future course of action, though that required
little consideration. It had been
already traced out for him, partly by the
Condesa, in an interview he held with her
but an hour before, and partly by instructions
he had received when up at the old convent
direct from the lips of Don Rupert. Therefore,
hurried as was his retreat, he was not

making it as one who went blindly, and
without definite aim. He had this, with a
point to be reached ; which, could he only
arrive at, not only might his own safety be
secured, but that of those he was equally
anxious about, now more imperilled than
himself.

With a full comprehension of their danger,
and the hope of being able to avert it, soon
as the twilight deepened to darkness, he
forsook his temporary place of concealment ;
and, returning to the lane, glided noiselessly
along it towards the main road. Coming
out upon this, he turned to the left, and
without looking behind, hurried up the hill
as fast as his Hmbs could carry him.

Perhaps better for him had he looked behind
; and yet in the end it might have
been worse. Whether or no, he was followed
by a man — if it were a man — and, if a thing,

not his own shadow. A grotesque creature,
seemingly all arms and legs, moved after,
keeping pace with him, no matter how rapidly
he progressed. Not overtaking him ; though
it looked as if able to do so, but did not wish.
Just so it was — the stalker being Zorilla.

The stalk had risen rather accidentally.
The hunchback — now in a manner attached
to the party of Hussars — had been himself
loitering near the end of the lane, and saw
the cicero as he came out on the road.
He knew the latter was being sought for,
and by no one more zealously than himself.
Besides cupidity, he was prompted by burning
revenge. The disappearance of his ill-gotten
treasure was no longer a mystery to
him. The abandoned halters, with the horses
for which they had been intended, told him
all. Only the cicero could have carried
the things off.

And now, seeing the latter as he stole
away in retreat, his first impulse was to
raise the hue and cry, and set the soldiers
after. But other reflections, quick succeeding,
restrained him. They might not be in time
to secure a capture. In the darkness there
was every chance of the merito eluding
them. X tract of forest was not far ofi", and
he would be into it before they could come
up. Besides, the hunchback had also conjectured
that the failure of their overnight
expedition was due to Jose. He must have
overheard that conversation with the colonel
of Hussars, and carried it direct to those
whom it so seriously concerned, thus saving
them from the surprise intended. In all
likelihood he was now on his way to another
interview with them.

If so, and if he, Zorilla, could but spot
the place, and bring back report of it to

Santander, it would give him a new claim
for services, and some compensation for the
loss he had sustained through the now hated
cicero.

Soon as resolved, he lost not a moment
in making after, keeping just such distance
between as to hinder Jose from observing
him. He had the advantage in being behind ;
as it was all uphill, and from below he could
see the other by the better light above, while
himself in obscurity. But he also availed
himself of the turnings of the road, and the
scrub that grew alongside it, through which
he now and then made way. His long legs
gave a wonderful power of speed, and he
could have come up with the merito at any
moment. He knew that, but knew also
it would likely cost him his life. For the
cicero must be aware of what he had done —
enough to deserve death at his hands. He

might well dread an encounter, and was
careful to avoid it. Indeed, but for his
belief that he was an overmatch for the other
in speed he would not have ventured after
him.

For nearly five miles up the mountain
road the stalk was continued. Then he,
whose footsteps were so persistently dogged,
was seen to turn into a side path, which led
along a ravine still upward. But the change,
of course, did not throw off the sleuth-hound
skulking on his track, the latter also entering
the gorge, and gliding on after.

There it was darker, from the shadow of
the overhanging cliffs ; and for a time the
hunchback lost sight of him he was following.
Still he kept on, groping his way, and at
length was rewarded by seeing a light — a
great blaze. It came from a bivouac fire,
which threw its red glare on the rocks around,

embracing within its circle the forms of men
and horses. Armed men they were, and
horses caparisoned for war ; as could be told
by the glint of weapons and accoutrements
given back to the fire's blaze.

There appeared • to be over a hundred of
them ; but the hunchback did not approach
near enough to make estimate of their number.
Enough for him to know who they
were ; and this knowledge he obtained by
seeing a man of gigantic size standing by
the side of the fire — the 'big Tejano!''
He saw, too, that the cicero had got upon
the ground, his arrival creating an excitement.
But he stayed to see no more : his
purpose was fulfilled ; and turning back
down the ravine, he again got out to the
road, where he put on his best speed in return
for Tlalpam.

Ready TO START.

S in all Mexican country houses of
the class mansion, that of Don
Ignacio Valverde was a quadrangular
structure enclosing an inner courtyard
— the patio. The latter a wide open
area, flagged, in its centre a playing fountain,
with orange trees and other ornamental evergreens
growing in great boxes around it.
Along three sides ran a verandah gallery,

raised a step or two above the pavement,
with a baluster and railing between. Upon
this opened the doors of the different chambers,
as they would into the hall way of an
English house. Being one-storeyed, even the
sleeping apartments were entered direct from
it.

That into which the ladies had retired was
the quarto che camera of Don Luisa herself.
No sentry had been stationed at its door ;
this being unnecessary, in view of one posted
at the entrance to the patio. But through
a casement window, which opened into the
garden at the back, they could see such precaution
had been taken. A soldier out therewith
carbine thrown lightly over his left
arm, was doings his beat backwards and forwards.


As they had no thought of attempting
escape, they might have laughed at this, had

they been in a mood for merriment. But
they were sad, even to utter prostration.

Only for a time, however ; then something
of hope seemed to reanimate the Condesa,
and communicate itself to her companion.
It was after a report brought in by Pepita ;
for the lady's maid was allowed to attend
upon them, coming and going freely.

He's got away — safe ! " were her words,
spoken in a cautious but cheering tone, as
for the second time she came into the room.

Are you sure, Pepita ? "

It was the Countess who put the question.

Quite sure, your ladyship. I've been all
around the place, to the stable, grounds,
everywhere, and couldn't hear or see anything
of him. Oh ! he's gone, and so glad
I am. They'd have made him prisoner too.
Thanks to the Blessed Virgin, they haven't."

The thanksgiving was for Jose, and however

fervent on Pepita's part, it was as fervently
responded to by the others, the
Condesa seeming more especially pleased at
the intelligence.

She better understood its importance, for,
but the hour before, she had given him conditional
instructions, and hoped he might be
now in the act of carrying them out.

Upheld by this hope, which the Dona
Luisa, when told of it shared with her, they
less irksomely passed the hours.

But at length, alas ! it, too, was near being
given up, as the night grew later, nearing
midnight. Then the little mercia came in
charged with new intelligence ; not so
startling, since they anticipated it. The
Dunno had got home, and, as themselves, was
under arrest. Astounded by what he had
learned on return, and angrily protesting,
the soldiers had rudely seized hold of him.

even refusing him permission to speak with
his daughter.

She had harboured a belief that all might
be well on the coming home of her father.
The last plank was shattered now. From
the chair of the cabinet minister Don Ignacio
Valverde would step direct into the cell of
a prison ! Nothing uncommon in the political
history of Mexico — only one of its " costs ".

On their feet they were now, and had come
close to the door, which was held slightly
open by Pepita. There they stood listening
to what was going on outside. The sounds
of revelry lately proceeding from the sala
grande were no more heard. Instead, calls
and words of command in the courtyard, with
a bustle of preparation. Through the trellis-work
they could see a carriage with horses
attached, distinguishable as their own. It
Twas the same which had just brought Don

Ignacio from the city. But the heads of
the frlsones were turned outward, as if it
was intended to take them back. Men on
horseback were moving around it ; soldiers,
as could be seen by their armour gleaming in
the moonlight.

Those reo^ardino^ their movements were
not left long in suspense as to their meaning.
One of the soldiers on foot, whose sleeve
chevrons proclaimed him a corporal, stepped
ujD into the corridor, and advancing along it,
halted in front of their door. Seeing it open,
with faces inside, he made a sort of military
salute, in a gruff voice saying :

Senoritas ! Carriage ready. I've orders
to conduct you to it without delay."

There was something offensive in the man's
manner. He spoke with a thick tongue, and
was evidently half intoxicated. But his air
showed him in earnest.

You'll allow US a little time — to put on
our cloaks ? "

The request came from the Condesa, who
for a certain reason was wishful to retard
their departure as long as might be possible.

'' Car red — {/" drawled out the cato, the
same who had won the dagger from darling
Perico. '' I'd allow such beautiful conceals
as you any time — all night — if 'twere only
left to me. For myself, I'd far rather stick
to these snug quarters, and the company of
of this pretty muchacha.''

At which, leaning forward, with a brutish
leer, he attempted to snatch a kiss from
Pepita.

The girl shrunk back, but not till she had
rebuked him vdth an angry retort and a slap
across the cheek. It stung him to losing
temper, and without further ceremony he
said spitefully —

3—13

Come, come, Til have no more dilly-dallying
; 710S vcunos ! "

There was no alternative but to obey ; his
attitude told them he would insist upon it,
and instantly. Time for cloaking had been
a pretence on their part. They were expecting
the summons, and the wraps were
close at hand. Flinging them around their
shoulders, and drawing the hoods over their
heads, they issued out upon the corridor,
and turned along it — the soldier preceding,
with the air of one who conducted criminals
to execution.

A short flight of steps led down to the
pavement of the court. On reaching these,
they paused and looked below. There was
still a bustling; about the carriage, as if someone
had just been handed into it. Several
of the soldiers were on foot around it, but
the majority were in their saddles ; and of

these three or four could be distinguished as
officers by the greater profusion of gold lace
on their jackets and dolmans — for they were
all Hussars. One who glittered more than
any, seeing them at the head of the stair,
gave his horse a prick with the spur, and
rode up. Colonel Santander it was, like all
the rest somewhat excited by drink ; but still
not so far gone as to forget gallantry, or
rather the pretence of it.

Ladies," he said, T\T.th a bow and air of
maudlin humility, ''I have to apologise for
requiring you to start out on a journey at
such a late hour. Duty is often an ungracious
master. Luckily, your drive is not to be a
very extended one — only to the city ; and
you'll have company in the carriage. The
Dona Luisa ^t.11 find her father at home."

Neither vouchsafed rejoinder — not a word
scarce giving him the grace of a look.

Which a little nettling him, his smooth tone
changed to asperity, as addressing himself to
the soldier, he gave the abrupt order :

Cato ! take them on to the carriage."

On they were taken ; as they approached it,
perceiving a face inside, pale as the moonbeams
that played upon it. It was a very
picture of dejection ; for never had Don
Ignacio Valverde experienced misery such ashe
felt now.

"tis you, father!" said his daughter, springing
up, throwing her arms around him, and
showering kisses, where tears already trickled.
You a prisoner too !"

Aye, nina mia. But sit down. Don't be
alarmed ! It will all come right. Heaven
will have mercy on us, if men do not. Sit
down, Luisa !"

She sat down mechanically, the Countess
by her side ; and the door was banged to

behind them. Meanwhile, Pepita, who insisted
on accompanying her mistress, had
been handed np to the box by a cicero
strange to her ; one of the soldiers, pressed
into the service for the occasion, a quondam
"jarvey," who understood the handling of
horses as every Mexican does.

All were now ready for the road ; the dismounted
Hussars had vaulted into their
saddles, the " march " was commanded, and
the driver had drawn his whip to lay it on
his horses, when the animals jibbed, rearing
up, and snorting in affright !

No wonder; with such an object suddenly
coming under their eyes. An oddly-shaped
creature that came scrambling; in through
the saguan and made stop beneath their
very noses. A human being withal ; dio,
soon as entering, called out, in a clear voice —

"Where is the Colonel ?"

SUEEENDEE!"

F the carriage horses were startled
by the apparition, no less so were
the Hussars formed round. Equally
frightened these, though not from the same
cause. The hunchback — for it was he — had
become a familiar sight to them ; but not
agitated as he appeared to be now. He was
panting for breath, barely able to gasjD out
the interrogation, " Atone 'steel Coronel ? "

His distraught air and the tone told of
some threatening danger.

Here ! " called out Santander, springing
his horse a length or two forward, " What
is it, sirrah ? "

"The enemy, Senor Coronel," responded
the dwarf, sliding close in to the strip

Enemy ! What enemy 1 "

"Them we missed catching — Don Rupert o,
the Irlandes, the big Tejano."

« Ha !— They !— Where ! "

Close by. S nor. I saw them round
a great camp fire up in the mountains.
They're not there now. I came on to tell
you. I ran as fast as ever I was able,
but they've been following. I could hear
the tramp of their horses behind all the way.
They must be near at hand now. Hark ! "

Patriae y Libertad ! "

The cry came from without, in the tone

of a charging shibboleth, other voices adding,
Mueran los tyrannous ! " Instantaneously succeeded
by the cracking of carbines, with
shouts, and the clash of steel against steel —
the sounds of a hand-to-hand fight, which
the stamping and snorting of horses proclaimed
between cavalry.

Never was conflict of shorter duration ; over
almost before they in the courtyard could
realise its having commenced. The confused
sounds of the melee lasted barely a minute
when a loud huzza, drowning the hoof-strokes
of the retreating horses, told that victory had
declared itself for one side or the other. They
who listened were not long in doubt as to
which sent up that triumphant cheer. Through
the front gate, standing open, burst a mass of
mounted men, some carrying lances couched
for the thrust, others with drawn sabres, many
of their blades dripping blood. On came they

into the courtyard, still vociferating : " Mueran
los tyrannous !" while he at their head soon as
shoeing[ himself, called out in a commanding;
voice, '' Erudite ?"

By this a change had taken place in the
tableau of figures beside the carriage. The
Hussars having reined back, had gathered in a
ruck around their colonel, irresolute how to
act. Equally unresolved he to order them.
That cry, " Country and Liberty," had struck
terror to his heart ; and now seeing those it
came from, recognising; the three who rode
foremost — as in the clear moonlight he could
the blood of the craven ran cold. They
were the men he had subjected to insult, direct
degradation ; and he need look for no mercy
at their hands. With a spark of manhood,
even such as despair sometimes inspires, he
would have shown fight. Major Eamirez
would, and did ; for at the first alarm he had

galloped out to the gate and there met
death.

Not so Santander, who, although he had
taken his sword out of its scabbard, made no
attempt to use it, but sat shivering in his
saddle as if the weapon was about to drop
from his hand.

On the instant after a blade more firmly
held, and better wielded, flashed before his
eyes ; he who held it, as he sprung his horse
up, crying out :

'' Carlos Santander ! your hour has come !
Scoundrel ! This time I intend killing you."

Even the insulting: threat stung; him not to
resistance. Never shone moonlight on more
of a poltroon, the glitter and grandeur of his
warlike dress in striking contrast with his
cowardly mien.

Miserable wretch," cried Kearney — for it
was he who confronted him — " I don't want to

kill you in cold blood. Heaven forbid my
doing murder. Defend yourself."

He defend himself !" scornfully exclaimed a
voice — that of Oris Rock. " He assent as
much as do that. He hasn't the steel shirt on
now."

Yet another voice at this moment made
itself heard, as a figure feminine became
added to the group. Luisa Yalverde it was,
who, rushing out of the carriage and across
the courtyard, cried out —

Spare his life, Don Florencio. He's not
worthy of your sword."

You're right thar, young lady," endorsed
the Texan, answering for Kearney. " That
he ain't — an' bare worth the bit o' lead that's
inside o' this ole pistol. For all, FU make
him a present o' 't — thar, dang ye."

The last words were accompanied by a flash
and a crack, causing Santander's horse to shy

and rear u|). When the fore hoofs of the
animal returned to the flags, they but missed
coming down upon the body of its rider, now
lying lifeless along them.

That's gin him his quietus, I reeking,"
observed Rock, as he glanced down at the
dead man, whose face upturned had the full
moonlight upon it, showing handsome features,
that withal were forbidding in life, but now
more so in the ghastly pallor of death.

No one stayed to gaze upon them, least of
all the Texan ; who had yet another life to
take, as he deemed in the strict execution
duty and satisfaction of justice. For it too
was forfeit by the basest betrayal. The
soldiers were out of their saddles now,
prisoners all ; having surrendered without
striking a blow. But crouching away in a
shadowy corner was that thing of deformity,
who, from his diminutive size might well

have escaped observation. He did not, however.
The Texan had his eyes on him all
the while, having caught a glimpse of him
as they were riding in at the gate. And in
those eyes now gleamed the light of a
vengeance not to be allayed save by a life
sacrificed. If Santander on seeing Kearney
believed his hour was come, so did the dwarf
as he saw Oris Rock striding towards him.
Caught by the collar, and dragged out into
the light he knew death was near now.

In vain his protestations and piteous
appeals. Spite of all, he had to die. And
a death so unlike that usually meted out to
criminals, as he himself to the commonality
of men. No weapon was employed in putting
an end to him ; neither gun nor pistol, sword
nor knife. Letting; o;o hold of his collar,
the Texan grasped him around the ankles,
and nth a brandish raising him aloft, brought

his head down upon the pavement. There
was a crash as the breaking of a cocoa-nut
shell by a hammer ; and when Rock let go,
the mass of mis-shapen humanity dropped
in a dollop upon the flags, arms and legs
limp and motionless, in the last not even the
power left for a spasmodic kick.

Ye know, Cap," said the Texan, justifying
himself to Kearney, "I'd be the last man
to do a cruel thing. But to rid the world o'
sech varmint as them, 'cording to my way o'
thinking, air the purest humanity."

A doctrine which the young Irishman was
not disposed to dispute just at that time,
being otherwise and better occupied, holding
soft hands in his, words exchanging with
sweet lips, not unaccompanied by kisses.
Near at hand Don Rupert was doing the
same, his vis-a-vis being the Condesa.

But these moments of bliss were brief — had

need be. The raid of the Free Lances down to
San Augustin was a tiling of risk, only to have
been attempted by lovers who believed their
loved ones were in deadly danger. In another
hour or less, the Hussars who had escaped
would report themselves at San Angel and
Chapultepec — then there would be a rush of
thousands in the direction of Tlalpam.

So there was in reality — soldiers of all arms,
"horse, foot, and dragoons". But on arrival
there they found the house of Don Ignacio
Yalverde untenanted ; even the domestics
had gone out of it ; the carriage, too, which
has played such an important part in our tale,
along with the noble prisoner. The horses
had not been taken out of it, nor any change
made in the company it carried off. Only
in the driver, the direction, and cortege.
Jose again held the reins, heading his horses
up the mountain road, instead of towards

Mexico ; while in place of Colonel Santander's
Hussars, the Free Lances of Captain Euperto
Eivas now formed a more friendly escort.

CONCLUSION.

BOUT a month after in San Augustin,
[^^^Pi a small two-masted vessel — a goleta
might have been observed standing
on tacks off the coast of Oaxaca, as if
working against the land wind to make to
the mouth of Eio Tecoyama — a stream which
runs into the Pacific near the south-western
corner of that State. Only sharp eyes
could have seen the schooner; for it was
3—14

night, and the night was a very dark one.
There were eyes sharply on the look-out for
her, however, anxiously scanning the horizon
to leeward, some of them through glasses.
On an elevated spot among the mangroves,
by the river's mouth, a party was assembled,
in all, about a score individuals. They were
mostly men, though not exclusively ; three
female figures being distinguishable, as forming
part of the group. Two of them had the
air, and wore the dress, of ladies, somewhat
torn and travel stained ; the third was in
the guise of a maid-servant attending them.
They were the Condesa Almonte, the Don
Luisa Yalverde, and her ever faithful Pepita.

Among the men were six, with whom the
reader has acquaintance. Don Ignacio,
Kearney, Rock, Eivas, Jose, aud he who
had been major-domo in the old monastery,
baptismal named Gregorio. Most of the

others, described, had also spent some time
in the establishment with the monks while
playing the part of Free Lances. They
were, in fact, a remnant of the band — now
broken up and dispersed.

But why I When last seen it looked as
though their day of triumph had come, or
was at all events near. So would it have
been but for a betrayal, through which the
pronunciamento had miscarried, or rather did
not come off. The Dictator, well informed
about it — further warned by what occurred
at San Augustin — had poured troops over
the Sierras into Oaxaca in force sufficient to
awe the leaders of the intended insurrection.
It was but by the breadth of a hair that
his late Cabinet Minister, and those who
accompanied him, were able to escape to
the sequestered spot where we find them,
on the shore of the South Sea. To Alvarez,

chief of the Pints, or " spotted Indians,"
were they indebted for safe conduct thither ;
he himself having adroitly kept clear of all
compromise consequent on that grit unraised.
Furthermore, he had promised to provide
them with a vessel in which they might escape
out of the country ; and it was for this they
were now on the look-out.

When Euperto Eivas, gazing through that
same telescope he had given Florence Kearney
to make survey of the valley of Mexico, cried
out, " La goleta ! " every eye around him
brightened, every heart beat joyously.

Still more rejoiced were they when, after
an hour's tacking against the land breeze, the
goleta got inside the estuary of the stream,
and working up, brought to by the edge of
the mangroves.

Unencumbered with heavy baggage, they
were all soon aboard, and in three days after

debarked at the port of Panama. Thence
crossing the Isthmus to Chagres, another seagoing
craft carried them on to the city, where
they need no longer live in fear of Mexico's
despot.

Back to his old quarters in New Orleans
had Don Ignacio repaired ; again under the
ban of proscription, his estates sequestrated
as before. So, too, those of the Condesa
Almonte.

But not for all time, believed they. They
lived in hope of a restoration.

Nor were they disappointed ; for it came.
The pronunciamento delayed was at length
proclaimed, and carried to a successful issue.
Once again throughout the land of Anahuac
had arisen a " grit," its battle cry " Patria
y Libertad ! " so earnestly and loudly shouted
as to drive the Dictator from his mock throne ;
sending him, as several times before, to seek
safety in a foreign land.

Nor were the " Free Lances " unrepresented
in this revolutionary struggle ; instead,
they played an important part in it. Ere it
broke out, they who had fled the country
re-entered it over the Texan border, and
rejoining their brethren became once more
ranged under the leadership of Captain
Euperto Eivas, with Florence Kearney as his
lieutenant, and Oris Rock a sort of attache
to the band, but a valuable adjunct to its
fighting force.

^ jfc ^ -^ ^ ^ -^ ^

Swords returned to their scabbards, bugles
no longer sounding; war signals, it remains
but to speak of an episode of more peaceful
and pleasant nature, which occurred at a
later period, and not so very long after. The
place was inside the Grand Cathedral of
Mexico, at whose altar, surrounded by a
throng of the land's elite, bells ringing, and

organ music vibrating on the air, stood three
couples, waiting to be wedded.

And wedded they where ; Don Euperto
Eivas to the Condesa Almonte, Florence
Kearney to the Dona Luisa Valverde, and —
Jose to Pepita.

Happy they, and happy also one who was
but a witness of the ceremony, having a
better view of it than most of the spectators,
from being the head and shoulders taller than
any. Need we say this towering personage
was the big Tejano ? Oris looked on delightedly,
proud of his comrade and protege,
with the beautiful bride he had won and was
wedding. For all it failed to shake his own
faith in single blessedness. In his eyes there
was no bride so beautiful as the '' Land of
the Lone Star," no wife so dear as its wild
purairas ". And to them after a time he
returned ; oft around the camp-fire entertaining

his companions of the chase with an
account of his adventures in the Mexican
valley — how he had there figured in the
various roles of jail-bird, scavenger, friar,
and last of all as one of the Free Lances.

A WOMAN'S SCHEME.

Y poor Rupert is indeed|in danger !

Now I am sure of it. Ah ! even

to his life ! And I may be the

cause of his losing it."

So spoke the Countess Almonte, half in

soliloquy, though beside her sat her friend
2—1

Luisa Valvercle. They were in a carriage
on return from their fruitless visit to the
Dictator. It was the Countess' own landau,
which had remained waiting for them outside
the Palace gates.

The other, absorbed with her own anxieties,
might not have noticed what was said but
for its nature. This, being in correspondence
with what was at the moment in her own
mind, caught her ear, almost making her
start. For she, too, was thinking of a life
endangered, and how much that danger might
be due to herself. It was not poor Euperto's
life, but poor Florencio's.

You the cause, Ysabel !" she said not in
surprise, save at the similarity of their
thoughts. "Ah! yes; I think I comprehend
you."

If not, amiga, don't ask explanation of
it now. It's a hateful thing, and I dislike

to think, much more speak of it. Some
other time I'll tell you all. Now we've
work to do — a task that will take all our
energies — all our cunning to accomplish it.
However is it to be done? Volga me
Dios!"

To her interrogatory she did not expect
reply. And the desponding look of Luisa
Valverde showed she had none to give that
would be satisfactory ; for she quite understood
what was the task spoken of, and
equally comprehended the difficulty of its
accomplishment. Perplexed as the Countess
herself, and possibly more despairing, she
could but echo the exclamatory words :
How indeed ! Volga me Dios"
For awhile they sat without further exchange
of speech, both buried in thought.
Not long, however, when the Countess again
spoke, saying —

You're not good at dissembling, Luisita ;
I wish you were."

Santissima ! " exclaimed her friend, alike
surprised at the remark as its abruptness.
Why do you wish that, Ysabel ? "

Because I think I know a way by which
something might be done — if you were but
the woman to do it."

Oh, Ysabelita ! I will do anything to get
Florencio out of prison."

It isn't Florencio I want you to get out,
but Rupert. Leave the getting out of
Florencio to me."

Still more astonished was Don Ignacio's
daughter. What could the Countess mean
now ? She put the question to her thus —

What is it you desire me to do ? "

"Practise a little deception — play the
coquette — that's all."

It was not in Luisa Valverde's nature.

If she had many admirers, and she had — some
of them over head-endears in love with her —
it was from no frivolity, or encouragement
given them, on her part. From the day
Florence Kearney first made impression upon
her heart, it had been true to him, and she
loyal throughout all. So much that people
thought her cold, some even pronouncing hera
prude. They knew not how warmly that
heart beat, though it was but for one. Thinking
of this one however, what the Countess
proposed gave her a shock, which the latter
perceiving, added, with a laugh —

Only for a time, amiga mia. I don't
want you to keep it up till you've got a
naughty name. Nor to make fools of all
the fine gentlemen I see dangling around you.
Only one."

Which one ? "

She was not averse to hearing what the

scheme was, at all events. How could she
be, in view of the object aimed at ?

A man," pursued the Countess," who can
do more for us than your father ; more than
we've been able to do ourselves."

"Who is he?"

"Don Carlos Santander, colonel of hussars
on the staff — aide-de-camp and adjutant to
El Excellentissimo in more ways than military
ones — some not quite so honourable, 'tis said.
Said also, that this staff colonel, for reasons
nobody seems to know, or need we care, has
more influence at Court than almost anyone else.
So what I want you to do is to utilise this influence
for our purpose which I know you can."

Ah, Ysabelita ! How much you are mistaken,
to think I would influence him to that !
Carlos Santander would be the last man to
help me in procuring pardon for Florencio —
the very last. You know why."

Oh yes ; I know. But lie may help mein
procuring pardon for Rupert. Luckily my
good looks, if I have any, never received
notice from the grand colonel, who has eyes
only for you ; so he's not jealous of Euperto.
As the obsequious servant of his master,
hostile to him no doubt ; but that might be
overcome by your doing as I should direct."

But what would you have me do."

Show yourself complaisant to the Colonel.
Only in appearance, as I've said ; and only
for a time till you've tried your power over
him, and see with what success."

I'm sure it would fail."

I don't think it would, amiga mia ; and
will not, if you go about it according to
instructions. Though it may cost you
some unpleasantness, Luisita, and an effort,
you'll make it for my sake, won't you ?
And as a reward," pursued the Countess,

as if to render her appeal more surely
effective, " I shall do as much for you, and
in a similar way. For I, too, intend counterfeiting
complacency in a certain quarter, and
in the interest of a different individual —
Don Florencio. Now, you understand me V

Not quite yet."

Never mind. I'll make it more plain
by-and-bye. Only promise me that you'll
do "

Dearest Ysabelita ! I'd do anything for
you."

And Don Florencio. I thought that
would secure your consent. Well, mil mil
gracias ! But what a game of cross-purposes
we'll be playing ; I for you, and you for me,
and neither for ourselves ! Let us hope we
may both win."

By this the carriage had stopped in front
of the Casa Valverde to set down Dona Luisa.

The Countess alighted also, ordering the
horses home. It was but a step to her own
house, and she could walk it. For she had
something more to say which required saying
there and then.

Passing on into the patio, far enough to
be beyond earshot of the " cicero," and
there stopping, she resumed the dialogue at
the point where she had left off.

We must set to work at once," she said,
this very day, if opportunity offer. Perhaps
in the procession "

Oh ! Ysabel ?" interrupted the other,
how I dislike the thought of this procession
making merry as it were, and he in a
prison ! And we must pass it too — its very
doors ! I'm sure I shall feel like springing out
of the carriage and rushing inside to see him."

That would be just the way to ensure
your not seeing him — perhaps, never more.

The very opposite is what you must do, or
you'll spoil all my plans. But I'll instruct
you better before we start out."
You insist, then, on our going ?"
Of course, yes ; for the very reason — the
very purpose we've been speaking of. That's
just why I ask you to take me with you. It
will never clo to offend his High Mightiness,
angry as we may be with him. I'm now
sorry at having shown temper ; but how could
I help it, hearing Euperto called a robber ?
However, that may be all for the best. So,
upstairs ; turn out your guarda-roba, and
your jewel case ; array yourself in your richest
apparel, and be in readiness for the gilded
coach when it comes round. Carramba /"
she added after drawing out her jewelled
watch, — one of Losada's best — and glancing
at its dial, " we haven't a moment to spare, I
must be off to my toilet too."

She had made a step in the direction of the
street, when suddenly turning again she
added :

"As a last w T ord, lest I might forget it.
When next you appear in the Grand Presence
drop that forlorn doleful look. Misery is the
weakest weapon either man or woman can
make use of — the very worst advocate in
any cause. So don't show it, especially in
the company of Don Carlos Santander, wherein
all likelihood you will be before the end
of another hour. Try to look cheerful, put
on your sweetest smile, though it be a feigned
one ; as I intend doing for Antonio Lopez
de Santa Anna."

She took her departure now ; but as she
passed out through the saguan a cloud
could be seen upon her countenance, more
than that from the shadow of the arched
gateway, telling that she herself needed quite

as much as her friend, admonition to be
cheerful.

IX THE Sewers.

LONG with a score of other prisoners,

fP?«l§^ ^ e " cna i n g an o " °f the Acordada,
Kearney, Rock, Eivas, and the
dwarf were conducted out into the street,
and on the Calle de Plateros. Dominus,
the gaoler, went with them — having received
orders to that effect — carrying a heavy charta
with hard rawhide lash knotted at the end.
Their escort consisted of two or three files

of the prison guard, dirty looking soldiers of
the infantry, in coarse linen uniforms, stiff
shakes on their heads, their arm the old-fashioned
flint lock musket.

The scavengers had still their ancle chains
on, coupled two and two ; these lengthened,
however, to give more freedom for their work.
One reason for keeping them chained is to
economise the strength of the guard ; a single
sentry thus being as good as a dozen. Of
course, it is an additional precaution against
escape, a thing which might seem impossible
under the muzzles of muskets and bayonets
fixed. But to desperadoes such as are some
of the Acordada gaol birds it would not be
so if left leg free. More than once had the
attempt been made, and with success. For
in no city is it easier, or indeed so easy.
In the Mexican metropolis there are whole
districts where the policeman fears to show

his face, and a criminal pursued, even by
soldiers in uniform, would have every door
thrown open to him, and every opportunity
given for stowing himself away. Get he but
out into the country, and up to the mountains
— on all sides conveniently near — his
chances are even better since the first man
there met may be either footpad or salvador.

As said, the street to which the scavengers
were taken was the Calle de Plateros, where
it ends at the Alameda Gate. The covering
flags of the zancas had been already lifted
off, exposing to view the drain brimful of
liquid filth ; the tools were beside — scoops,
drags, and shovels having been sent on
before.

Soon on arriving on its edge, Dominus,
who kept close by the two couples in which
were the Tejanos, ordered them to "lay hold
and fall to".

There could be no question of refusal or
disobedience. From the way he twirled the
quiet between his fingers it looked as though
he wished there was, so that he might have
an excuse for using it. Besides, any hanging
back would be rewarded by a blow from
the butt of a musket, and, persisted in,
possibly a bayonet thrust — like as not to
lame the refractory individual for life.

There was no need for such violent measures
now. The others of the gang had done
scavenger work before ; and knowing its
ways, went at it as soon as the word was
given. Nolens volens Kearney and Cris
Rock, with their chain partners, had to do
likewise ; though, perhaps, never man laid
hold of labourers tool with more reluctance
than did the Texan. It was a long shafted
shovel that had been assigned to him, and
the first use he made of the implement was

to swing it round his head, as though he
intended bringing it down on that of one of
the sentries who stood beside.

Durnashun ! " he shrieked out, still brandishing
the tool and looking the soldier straight
in the face. " If 't want that the thing 'ud be
o' no use, an you aunt the one as is to blame,
I'd brain ye on the spot, } r e ugly yallerbelry.
Wage ! Let me get back to Texas, and grip o'
a good rifle, the Mexican as sums my way may
look out for particles forked lightning ! "

Though not comprehending a word of what
was said, the little manikin of a military
was so frightened by the big fellow's gestures
as to spring back several feet, with a look
of alarm so intense, yet so comical, as to
set the Texan off into a roar of laughter.
And still laughing he faced towards the
sewer, plunged in his implement and set

to work with the others.

2—2

At first the task was comparatively clean
and easy — a sort of skimming affair — the
scavengers keeping upon the pavement. The
necessity had not yet arisen for them going
down into the drain.

After a time, however, as the liquid got
lower and the sediment at the bottom too stiff
to be conveniently scooped up, a number of
them were ordered to " step in". It was a cruel,
brutal order, and Bill Sykes would have
declined sending his " bull-dawn " into that
sewer after rats. But Dominguez, a sort of
Mexican Bill Sykes, had no scruples about this
with the unfortunates he had charge of, and
with a " carajo " and a threatening flourish
of his whip, he repeated the order. One or
two of the forzados took the plunge good
humoured, even to laughing, as they dropped
into the stuff, waist deep, sending the mud in
splashes all round. The dainty ones went in

more leisurely, some of them needing a little
persuasion at the point of the bayonet.

Oris Rock was already down, having gone
voluntarily. Only one of each couple had been
ordered below ; and, much as he disliked the
dwarf, he had no wish to see him drowned or
suffocated, which the diminutive creature
would well nigh have been in the horrible
cesspool. Tall as the Texan was, the stuff
reached up to his thighs, the surface of the
street itself being on a level with his arm-pits :
while only the heads of the others could be
seen above the stones.

Neither Kearney nor Eivas had yet taken
the plunge. They still stood on the brink,
discussing the question of precedence. Not
that either wished the other to do the disagreeable
; instead, the reverse. Strange as it
may appear, knowing or believing him to be a
bandit, the young Irishman had taken a liking

to the Mexican, and the feeling was reciprocated
so that each was now trying to restrain
the other from entering the ugly gulf.

But their friendly contest was cut short by
the brutal gaoler ; who advancing grasped
Rivas by the shoulder, and with his other hand
pointing downward shouted, " Abajo !"

There was no help for it but obey ; the
alternative sure of being something worse.
For the man so rudely commanded went
down willingly ; indeed, with alacrity, to
satisfy his impulse of friendship for the
Irlandes.

Had Carlos Santander been there likely the
position would have been reversed, and
Kearney compelled to " take the ditch ".
But the Governor of the Acordada had control
of details, and to his hostility and spleen,
late stirred by that wordy encounter with
Eivas, the latter was no doubt indebted for

the partiality shown him by Don Pedro's head
turnkey.

In time, all were disposed of ; one of each
couple down in the sewer, pitching out its
sweet contents ; the other pressing them back
upon the pavement to prevent their oozing
in again. Either way the work was now
nasty enough ; but for those below, it was a
task too repulsive to set even the lowest pariah

THE Procession.

f^filSAGEEEABLE as was their job,
Nsfljlfl some of the forzados made light of
it, bandying jests with the street
passengers who did not find it safe to go too
near them. A scornful of the inky liquid
could be flung so as to spoil the polish on
boots, or sent its splashes over apparel still
higher. Even the vigilance of the sentries
could not prevent this, or rather they cared

not to exercise it. The victims of such
practical jokes were usually either of the
class plato, or the yet more humble
aboriginal accustomed to be put upon by
the soldiers themselves, who rather relished the
fun.

But only the more abandoned of the
gaol-birds behaved in this way, many of
them seeming to feel the degradation more
than aught else. For among them, as we
know, were men who should not have been
there. Some may have seen friends passing
by, who gave them looks of sympathy
or pity, and possibly more than one knew
himself under eyes whose expression told
of a feeling stronger than either of these —
love itself. Indeed this last, or something
akin to it, seemed the rule rather than
the exception. In Mexico, he must be a
deeply disgraced criminal whose sweetheart

would be ashamed of him ; and every now
and then, a brown skinned " muchacha "
might be seen crossing to where the
scavengers were at work, and with a muttered
word or two, passing something into
a hand eagerly outstretched to receive it.
The sentries permitted this, after examining
the commodity so tendered, and seeing
it a safe thing to be entrusted to the receiver.
These gifts of friendship, or gages clamour,
were usually eatables from the nearest
cook-shop ; their donors well knowing that
the fare of the Acordada was neither
plentiful nor sumptuous.

But beyond these interested ones, few
of the pedestrians stopped or even looked
at the chain-gang. To most, if not all,
it was an ordinary spectacle, and attracted
no more attention than would a crossing
sweeper on a London street. Not as

much as are the latter, as he is often
an Oriental. On that particular day,
however, the party of scavengers presented
a novelty, in having the two Tejanos in
it ; with a yet greater one in the odd
juxtaposition of Oris Rock, and his diminutive
"mate". In Mexico, a man over
six feet in height is a rarity, and as
Oris exceeded this by six inches, a rarer
sight still was he. The colossus coupled
to the dwarf, as Tulliver to Lilliputian — a
crooked Lilliputian as that — no wonder that
a knot of curious gazers collected around
them, many as they approached the grotesque
spectacle uttering ejaculations of
surprise.

"Ay Dios!" exclaimed one. Gigantic y
enano!" (a giant and a dwarf) — "and
chained together ! Who ever saw the

like ? "

Such remarks were continually passing
among the spectators who laughed as they
listened to them. And though the Texan
could not tell what they said, their
laughter "riled" him. He supposed it a
slur upon his extraordinary stature, of
which he was himself no little proud,
while they seemed to regard it sarcastically.
Could they have had translated to them
the rejoinders that now and then came
from his lips, like the rumbling of thunder,
they would have felt their sarcasm fully
paid back, with some change over. As a
specimen : —

Devil darn ye, for a set of callers
pygmies ! Ef I hed about a million
o' ye out in the open purairu, I'd gie you
something to lars at. Dod-rot me ! ef I
don't believe a pack o' coycoats ked chase
as many o' ye as they'd count themselves ;

once after running' ye clown 'ud scorn to
put tooth into yur stinking carcasses ! "

Fortunately for him, the " taller-jawed
pygmies " understood not a word of all this ;
else, notwithstanding his superior size and
strength he might have had rough handling
from them. Without that, he was badly
plagued by their behaviour, as a bull fretted
with flies ; which may have had something
to do with his readiness to go down into the
drain. There, up to his elbows, he was less

conspicuous, and so less an object of curiosity.

********

It had got to be noon, with the sun at
fire heat ; but for all the forzados were kept
on at work. No rest for them until the task
should be completed, and they taken back
to their prison quarters at a late hour of the
afternoon. The cruel gaoler told them soin
a jeering way. He seemed to take a

pleasure in making things disagreeable to
them, as he strutted to and fro along their
line, flourishing his quiet, and giving grand
exhibition of his " brief authority ".

A little after midday, however, there came
a change in their favour, brought 
circumstances. Groups of people began
to gather in the Cable de Plateros swarming
into it from side streets, and taking stand
upon the football. Soon they lined it all
along as far as the eye could reach. Not
pelados, but most of them belonging to a
class respectable, attired in their holiday
clothes, as on a dice de fiesta. Something
of this it was as the scavengers were presently
told, though some of them may have
had word of it before without feeling any
concern about it. Two, however, whom it
did concern — though little dreamt they of
its doing so — were only made aware of what

the crowd was collecting for, when it began
to thicken. These were Kearney and Bias,
who knowing the language of the country,
could make out from what was being said
around them, that there was to be a function.
The foundation-stone of a new church was
to be laid in the suburb of San Corne, the
chief magistrate of the State himself to lay
it — with all ceremony and a silver trowel.
The procession, formed in the Piazza Grande,
would, of course, pass through the Calle de
Plateros, hence the throng of the people in
that street.

Functions and fiestas are of such frequent
occurrence in the Mexican metropolis — as
indeed everywhere else in that land of the
far niente — that this, an ordinary one, and
not much announced, excited no particular
interest, save in the suburb of San Corne
itself — a quarter where a church might be

much needed — being a very den of disreputable.
Still a large number of people had
put on their best apparel, and sallied forth
to witness the procession.

This did not delay long in showing itself.
It came heralded by the stirring notes of a
trumpet, then the booming of the big drum
in a band of music — military. A troop of
cavalry — Lancers — formed the advance, to
clear the way for what was to follow ; this
being a couple of carriages, in which were
seated the Bishop of Mexico and his ecclesiastical
staff, all in grand gaudy raiment;
on such an occasion the Church having precedence,
and the post of honour.

Behind came the gilded coach of the Dictator
— flanked on each side by guards in
gorgeous uniform — himself in it. Not alone,
but with one seated by his side, whose presence
there caused Florence Kearney surprise,

great as he ever experienced in his life.
Despite the coat of diplomatic cut and its
glittering insignia, he easily recognised his
ci-devant teacher of the Spanish tongue — Don
Ignacio Valverde !

But great as was his astonishment he was
left no time to indulge in it, or speculate
how his old "crammer" came to be there.
For close behind the Dictator's carriage,
followed another, holding one who had yet
more interest for him than Don Ignacio —
Don Ignacio's daughter !

SIGNIFICANT GLANCES.

ES ; the lady in the carriage was
Luisa Valvercle. Too surely she,
thought Florence Kearney ; for
seeing her there was painful to him — a shock
as one who sees the woman he loves in
in the jaws of some great danger. And so
he believed her to be, as a host of unpleasant
memories came crowding into his mind like
hideous spectres. No imagination either, buta

danger real and present before his eyes
at that moment, in the person of a man
riding by the side of the carriage in which
she sat — Carlos Santander. He it was, ina
gold laced uniform, with a smile of proud
satisfaction on his face. What a contrast to
the craven, crestfallen wretch who, under a
coating of dull green ooze, crawled out of
the ditch at Pontchartrain ! And a still
greater contrast in the circumstances of the
two men — fortunes, positions, apparel, everything
reversed.

The hussar colonel appeared not to be one
of the regular escorts attending upon the
Dictator ; but detached, and free to chose
his place in the procession. Well had he
chosen it, any one would say ; for there was
a second lady in the carriage, young and
and beautiful, too ; as may be guessed — the

Condesa Almonte. But he seemed to have
2—3

no eyes for her, nor words ; his looks and
speech all bestowed upon Luisa Valverde.
For he was smilingly conversing with her,
and she appeared to listen attentively, returning
his smiles !

A spectacle to Kearney not only saddening,
but maddening. Through his soul, dark as
winter now, swept dire bitter misgivings.

Are they married ? No. Tis not the
behaviour of man and wife. Soon will he —
engaged no doubt. Yes ; he has won her
heart after all ; likely had it then, when I
believed it mine. Such deception? 0, God!"

These unspoken questions and conjectures
passed through his mind rapidly as thought
itself.

They were interrupted by his seeing the
ladies — the carriage being now nearly abreast
turn their faces towards him in an odd
interrogative way. * The movement, abrupt

and sudden, seemed prompted ; and so had
it been by him on horseback. Florence
Kearney saw him nod in that direction, his
lips moving, but the distance was too great
to hear what he said.

Mira ! Los Tejanos ! " were Santander's
words, indicating the group of which they
formed part. " One of them is, if I mistake
not, an old acquaintance of yours, Don Luisa ?
And how strange ! " he added, feigning surprise.
" Chained to a criminal — no, let me
not call him that — an individual in whom
the Condesa Almonte takes an interest, if
rumour's to be believed. Is it so, Condesa 1 "

Neither of them made response, for neither
was now listening to him. Each had her
eyes upon that which engrossed all her attention,
one fixedly gazing at Florence
Kearney, the other at Euperto Eivas. Forby
the grace, or rather negligence, of their

guards, the latter was now up on the pavement.


What an interchange of glances between
the pairs thus brought face to face ! What
a variety of expression upon their features !
For varied and strong were their emotions
at this moment — surprise, sadness, sympathy,
indignation, and amidst all, conspicuous above
all, looks of unchanged ever-confiding love !

He who had brought about this odd interview
— for it had been pre-arranged — was
riding on the left and near side of the carriage,
the sewer being on the right and off ; which,
of course placed him behind the backs of the
ladies, as they now were, and hindered his
observing their faces. Could he have seen
them just then, he might have doubted the
success of his scheme, and certainly could not
have accounted it a triumph. For the eyes,
late turned smilingly upon himself, were now

regarding Florence Kearney with earnest
sympathetic gaze.

And the man, to whom this was given, was
trying his best to . interpret it. He saw that
she turned pale as her eyes first fell upon him.
That might be but surprise seeing him therewith
the consciousness of her own guilt. Or
was it pity ? If so, he would have spurned it.
All the tortures the Acordada could inflict
upon him ; all the toil and degradation would
be easier to bear than that. But no : It
could not be pity alone. The sudden start
and paling cheek ; the look of interest in
those eyes, beautiful as ever, and so well
remembered ; a flash in them that recalled the
old time when he believed her heart his ; all
spoke of something more than mere sympathy
with his misfortune. Before the carriage
moving slowly on, had carried her out of his
sight the jealous fancies so late harrowing his

soul, seemed to be passing away, as though
an angel was whispering in his ear : " She
loves you — still loves you !"

Needless to say, he was too much occupied
in reading the expression on Luisa Valverde's
face to give even a look to the other beautiful
one beside it. And alike was he forgetful
of the man who stood beside himself. Yet
between these two neglected individuals
glances were being exchanged also in earnest
and watchful glances which told of their being
as much interested in one another as he in
Luisa Valverde, or she in him. Better comprehending
one another, too, as a physiognomist
could have told observing the play of
their features. The first expression on those
of the Condesa was surprise, quick changing
to indignation, this as suddenly disappearing
or becoming subdued, restrained by a thought
or possibly a sign given by her " dear, noble

Rupert ". As evinced by the fond, yet
proud, sparkle of her eyes, he was no less dear
now, no less noble in that degrading garb,
than when she knew him in a gold-laced
uniform, splendid as that worn by Santander,
and he in her eyes ten times more worthy of
wearing it. If he had turned bandit, she did
not believe it ; though, believing it, she would
have loved him all the same. Nor in this
would she have so much differed from the rest
of her sex. Blameable as it may be — love —
even that of a lady — has but little to do with
the moralities ; and of a Mexican lady perhaps
less than any other. Certain, that Euperto
Eivas, robber or no, in that crossing of glances
with the Condesa Almonte, showed no sign
of jealousy ; instead full confidence of being
beloved by her.

Though the account of this little episode
seem long, the actual occurrence — gestures,

thoughts, looks, changes of facial expression —
was all comprised within a few seconds of time
scarce so much as a minute.

Then the carriage containing the two ladies
passed on out of sight, other carriages following
with other ladies in them ; more cavalry —
Lancers, Hussars, and heavy Dragoons — more
music, mingling with the shouts and cheers
of the fickle populace, as they swarmed along
the foot walk, every now and then vociferating
!

Viva, Santa Anna el Illustrissimo ! Viva,
el Salvador de la Patria /"

A Mysterious MISSIVE.

Isabel ! To think of it ! In the
chain-gang — in the sewers ! Madre
de Dios r

Thus passionately exclaimed Luisa Valverde,
half addressing herself to the Condesa Almonte,
in her father's house again, to which they had
just returned from the ceremony of the
procession. They were in the sala, seated
upon the chair, into which they flung themselves
as if overcome with fatigue.

And weariness it was, but not of the body.
Their souls were wearied through being
unable to give utterance to the thoughts
and passions that for hours had been convulsing
them. Ever since passing the changing
they had been forced to keep up faces,
seem as they felt not, smile when they could
have wept. This the Condesa had counselled
for reasons already hinted at ; and now back
home, with no one to see or hear, they were
giving way to the wild tumult of emotion so
long pent up.

For a time the Condesa made no rejoinder,
herself as much affected as her friend. Both
sat in despairing attitudes, heads drooped, and
hands clasping them as though they ached ;
bosoms rising and falling in laboured undulation,
the hearts within them painfully
pulsing. All so unlike themselves, in such
discordance with their great beauty, and the

rich robes they wore. Looking at two such
women, one could ill believe it possible for
them to be otherwise than happy ; yet at
that moment both were miserable as miserable
itself.

Ah, yes ! " sighed the Countess, at length,
and like as if awakening from some weird
dream, its impress still upon her face. " To
think of it ; and fearful it is to think of. I
understand things better now. My Rupert
is indeed in danger — more than I this morning
believed. And your Florencio too. I could
read his death in the eyes of Don Carlos
Santander ; and one told me the Tejanos are
all to be shot !"

0, Ysabel ! say not that ; if they kill him,
they may kill me ! The man I love ! Santa
Guadalupe — Blessed Virgin ! Save, oh, save
him from such a fate !"

Against the wall was a picture of this, the

patroness Saint of Mexico — for there is one
in every Mexican house — and, while speaking,
the young girl had risen from her chair, glided
across the room, and fallen upon her knees
before it. In this attitude she remained for
some moments, her hands crossed over her
breast, her lips moving as though she muttered
a prayer.

Altogether differently acted the Condesa.
She was not of the devotional sort, where it
seemed unlikely to be of practical service.
Good Catholic enough, and observant of all the
ceremonies, but no believer in miracles ; and,
therefore, distrustful of aught Santa Guadalupe,
or any other saint, could do for them. She
had more belief in the Cromwellian doctrine of
keeping the powder dry ; and that she meant
to practise it, not with powder, but with
her purse, was soon made evident by her
speech.

It's no use kneeling there," she said,
starting to her feet, and again showing spirit.
Let us pray in our hearts. I've been doing
that already, and I'm sure so have you.
Something else should be done now — another
effort made — this time with money ; no
matter how much it takes. Yes, Luisa, we
must act."

I want to act," rejoined the other, as she
forsook the kneeling posture, with an abruptness
not common to devotees. " Only tell me
how. Can you 1 "

For some seconds the Condesa let the
question remain unanswered. Once more
her hand had gone up to her head, the
jewelled fingers met and clasped upon her
brow — this time to quicken reflection. Some
scheme already half conceived, needing further
elaboration.

Whatever the plan, it was soon worked

out complete, as evinced by her words following.


Amiga mia ; is there in your service one
we can implicitly trust ? "

Jose. You know we can trust him."

True. But he won't do for the first step
to be taken : which is, indeed, only to deliver
a letter. But it needs being adroitly done,
and a woman will be the better for that.
Besides, Jose will be wanted for something
else, at the same time. There are two or
three of my own female following could be
relied on, so far as fidelity is concerned. But,
unluckily, they're all known on the Cable de
Plateros, as well as the street itself. And
there isn't any of them particularly intelligent,
or dexterous. What we stand in need
of now is one possessed of both these qualities
either woman or girl."

Would Pepita do ? "

You mean the little niestiza who was
with you at New Orleans ? "

The same. She's all that ; and besides,
devoted to me."

Don Ignacio's daughter had reason to know
this, from experience in the Casa de Calvo,
in which Pepita had played a part.

"She'll do," said the Countess; "the very
individual, from what I've seen of her. Get
me pen, ink, and paper — quick ! At the
same time summon Pepita ! "

The Countess was now all action; and,
responding to her roused energies, the other
rushed towards the bell-pull, and gave it
two or three vigorous jerks.

As it chanced there were writing materials
in the room ; and, while waiting for the bell
to be answered, the Countess made use of
them; hastily scribbling some words on a
sheet of paper, which she folded without

putting into an envelope. Instead, twisted
it between her finger, as if dissatisfied with
what she had written, and designed cancelling
it. Far from this her intention, as was soon
made manifest.

Muchacha ! " she said to Pepita, who,
being lady's maid, had answered the bell
herself. " Your mistress tells me you can
be trusted on a matter which calls not only
for confidence, but cleverness. Is that so ? "

I can't promise the cleverness, your ladyship
; but for the other, I think the Dona
Luisa knows she can rely on me."

You'd be good at delivering a letter,
without letting all the world into the secret,
I suppose ? "

I'll do my best, your ladyship, if Buena
command it."

"Yes, I wish it, Pepita," interposed Dona
Luisa, herself the " Buena ".

Muy bien Senorita. Into whose hands is
it to be put \ "

Though speaking direct to her own mistress,
the interrogatory was more meant for the
Condesa, between whose fingers and thumb
she saw the thing she was to take charge of.

The answer to her query called for some
consideration. The note was for Euperto
Kivas ; but the girl knew him not ; so how
could she give it him ?

Here was a difficulty not before thought
of, for a time perplexing both the ladies. In
this case Dona Luisa was the first to see
a way out of it, saying in a whisper : —

Let her give it to Florencio ; she knows
him, and he can "

Carramba ! " exclaimed the Countess

interrupting. " How wonderfully wise you

are, amiga ! The very thing ! And it never

occurred to me ! Now, you tell her what to do."
2—4

"This, Pepita," said her mistress, taking
the crumpled sheet from the Condesa, and
passing it to her maid, " this is to be delivered
to a gentleman you've seen, and
should know."

Where have I seen him, senorita ? "

"In New Orleans."

Do you mean Don Carlos, my lady ?"

No ;" the abrupt negative accompanied
with a dissatisfied look.

Who then, senorita ?"

"DonFlorencio."

Ay Dios ! Is he here ? I did not know it.
But where am I to find him V

No need to repeat the dialogue as continued.
Suffice it that, before leaving the
room, Pepita received full instructions whereto
find Don Florencio, and when found what
she was to do and say to him.

So far all this was easy enough. More

difficult the commission to be entrusted to
Jose — more dangerous, too. But it was made
known to him in less than twenty minutes
after ; receiving his ready assent to its execution
— though it should cost him his life, ashe
said. One motive for his agreeing to
undergo the danger was devotion to his young
mistress ; another to stand well with Pepita,
who had a power over him, and as he knew
had entered upon her part with an ardent
alacrity. But there was a third stimulus
to keep up his courage, should it feel like
failing — this having to do with the Condesa.
Drawing out her grand gold watch — good
value for a hundred dolores, and holding it
up before his eyes, she said :

That's your reward, Jose ; that or its
worth in money."

No need saying more. For the commission
he was to execute much preparation was

uwvERsmroFmiNnfs

THE FREE LANCES.

to be made, in all haste too. And in all
haste he set to making it — determined to win
the watch.

THE PLAY OF EYES.

|pl|S|HE ceremony of laying the founds
ironstone had been brief, and it
was yet only an early hour of the
afternoon when the procession passed back
along the Calle de Plateros. The scavengers
were still at work, and it is scarcely necessary
to say that two of their number were
earnestly on the look-out for a certain carriage.
Sorry plight as they were in, neither

felt ashamed or reluctant to come again under
those eyes, after the expression they had
observed in them. Rivas had hopes that in
another exchange of glances with the Condesa,
he might see something still further to instruct
him ; while Kearney not so confident
about his interpretation of those given to
himself, longed to have a second reading of
them.

Nor was he disappointed. The procession
returned sooner than they expected, the
looked-for carriage still holding its place in
the line ; the ladies in it, but now no officer
of hussars, nor any other, riding alongside.
Santander, an aide-de-camp as known, had
likely been ordered off on some official errand,
and likely too, his chief did not relish seeing
him so near that particular equipage. Whatever
the cause, his absence gave gratification
to the two men noting it. With less constraint

glances might now be exchanged —
even gestures.

And both were. The look Kearney had
given to him was accompanied by a nod of
recognition ; slight and timid, for it could
not well be otherwise under the circumstances.
But the eyes spoke more eloquently, telling
Mm of respect undiminished, faith that had
never faltered, love strong and true as ever.
If he read pity in them too, it was not such
as he would now spurn.

To Eivas were accorded signs of a very
different sort. He had them not only
from eyes, but the movement of a fan
and fingers. They seemed satisfactory to
him ; for as the carriage passed out of
sight, he turned to the other and said ina
cheerful whisper :

Keep up heart, camarado ! I perceive
you're not unknown to a friend of my

friend. You heard the brute of a gaol-governor
taunt me about a certain Condesa ? "

"I did."

Well ; that's the lady, alongside her
who's just been making eyes at you. An
old acquaintance of yours, I see ; and I
think could say where it was commenced.
Never mind about that now. Enough for
you to know, that if friendship can get
us out of this fix, with gold to back it,
we may yet have a chance of giving leg-bail
to the turnkeys of the Acordada."

Their dialogue was terminated by Dominguez,
who, temporarily absent for a swill
at one of the neighbouring pulquerias,
now returned to the superintendence of
his charge, and roughly commanded them

to resume their work.

********

For nearly another hour the work went

on, though not so regularly as before.
The stream of returning sightseers still
lined the footmarks, many of them showing
by their behaviour they had been
paying a visit to pulquerias too, and more
than once. Some stopped to fraternise
with the soldiers, and would have done
likewise with the forzados, if permitted.
They were not hindered, however, from
holding converse with the former, and extending
hospitality to them in the shape
of treats ; sentry after sentry stealing away
from his post after the proffered, and
coveted youthful. Nor was Dominguez an
exception, he too every now and then repeating
his visit to the dram-shop.

All this gave the scavengers licence of
speech, with some liberty of action, or
rather rest from their disagreeable task.
And in the interval, while they were thus

idling, the young Irishman noticed that
the eyes of his chain companion were
kept continuously on the footmarks, now
on one side now the other, his face towards
the Plaza Grande — as though he expected
to see some one coming that way.
Kearney himself was regarding the people
who came along — but only from curiosity —
when his attention was more particularly
drawn to one, who had come to a stop
on the sidewalk nearly opposite. This was
a girl of rather diminutive stature, dressed
in the ordinary fashion of the common
people, short-skirted petticoat, sleeveless
canis, arms, ankles, and feet bare ; but
the head, breast, and shoulders all under
one covering — the reboso. Even her face
was hidden by this, for she was wearing
it "tapado," one eye only visible, through
a little loop in the folded scarf, which

was kept open by the hand that held it.
The girl had drawn up in front of a
jeweller's window, as though to feast that
eye on the pretty things therein displayed.
And thus Kearney would not have noticed
her, any more than the others, many of
them in like garb passing to and fro.
But, just as his eye happened to light
upon her, he saw that hers — literally a
single one — was fixed upon him, regarding
him in a way altogether different from
that which might be expected on the part
of a chance stranger. Her attitude, too,
was odd. Though facing nearly square to
the shop window, and pretending to look
into it, her head was slightly turned, and
the eye surely on him.

At first he was puzzled to make out
what it could mean, and why the girl
should be taking such an interest in him.

Possibly, had she been wearing shoes and
stockings, he might have come easier to
the comprehension of it. But a little
brown skinned, barefooted muchacha, in a
petticoat of common stuff, and cheap
scarf over her shoulders, he could think
of no reason why she should have ought
to do with him.

Only for a few seconds, however, was
he thus in the dark. Then all became
clear, the eclaircissement giving him a start,
and sending the blood in quick rush
through his veins — pleasant withal. For
the girl seeing she had caught his attention,
relaxed her clasp upon the scarf,
partially exposing her face, and the other
eye.

Kearney needed not seeing the whole of
it for recognition now. Well remembered
he those features — pretty in spite of the

dark skin — lie had often seen wreathed
with pleasant smiles, as their owner used
to open the door for him in the Casa de
Calvo.

A Letter DEXTEROUSLY DELIVERED.

EPITA it was, though in a different
style of dress to what he had
been accustomed to see her in ; as
at New Orleans she had not kept to her national
costume. Besides, there was a soupcon of
shabbiness about her present attire, and then
the hopeless feet !

Dismissed the Valverde service — out of
a situation — poor girl ! "

He would not have so pityingly reflected,
had he seen her as she was but a short half-hour
before, in a pretty muslin dress, snow-white
stockings, and blue satin slippers. Since
then she had made a change in her toilet
under direction and by help of the Condesa,
who had attired her in a way more befitting
the task intended.

Kearney in full belief of her being a discharged
servant remembering her many little
kindnesses to himself in the Casa de Calvo,
w r as about to call her up, and speak a word
of sympathy for old time's sake. Dominguez
was still absent, and the nearest sentry engaged
in a chaffing encounter with some one
in the crowd.

Just then he observed a slight tremor of
her head, and with a sudden movement of
the hand which seemed to say, " No, don't
speak to me ". She too could talk that

mute language, so well understood in her
country.

So restrained, he kept silent ; to see her
now glance furtively around, as if to make
sure no one else was observing her. She
had again closed the scarf over her face, butin
the hand that held it under her chin
something white — a piece of paper he supposed
— appeared ; just for one instant, then
drawn under. Another significant look accompanied
this gesture, saying plain as word
could speak it.

You see what I've got for you ; leave the
action all to me."

He did, for he could not do otherwise ; he
was fixed to this spot, she foot free. And
the use she now made of this freedom was
to walk straight out into the street, though
not as coming to him ; instead, her steps,
as her eyes, were directed towards Cris Rock

and the hunchback, who were at work some
paces further on. She seemed bent on
making closer inspection of the odd pair,
nor would any one suppose she had other
object in crossing over to them.

Xo one did, save Kearney himself. Eivas
had been again ordered into the sewer, and
was at work in it. Besides, he did not know
Pepita, though he was the one she most
wished to be near. Chiefly for him was the
communication she had to make.

It could not be, however, without a
demonstration likely to be observed, therefore
dangerous. But her wit was equal to
occasion, proving how well the ladies had
chosen their letter-carrier.

Ay Dios ! " she exclaimed aloud, brushing
past the young Irishman, and stopping
with her eyes bent wonderingly on the
strangely-contrasted couple ; then aside in

sotto voce to Kearney, whom she had managed
to place close behind her, apparently unconscious
of his being there — "A billetita,
Don Florencio — not for you — for the Senor
Eivas — you can give it him — I aren't. Try
to take it out of my hand without being
seen." Then once more aloud. " Gigantic
y enano ! " just as others had said, " Rue cosa
estrange ! " (what a strange thing).

She need not say any more, nor stay there
any longer. For while she was speaking the
crumpled sheet had passed through the fringe
of the scarf, out of her fingers into those of
Don Florencio, who had bent him to his work,
bringing his hand to the right place for the
transfer.

Her errand, thus vicariously accomplished
with another wondering look at the giant and
dwarf, and another " Ay Dios /" she turned to
go back to the side-walk. But before passing

Kearney she managed to say something more
to him.

Carriage will come along soon — two ladies
in it — one you know — one dear to you, as you
to her."

Sweet words to him, though muttered, and
he thanked her who spoke them — in his heart.
He dared not speak his thanks, even in whisper
; she was already too far off, tripping back
to the ragged football, along which she
turned, soon to disappear from his sight.

What she had said about the coming of a
carriage was to Kearney not altogether intelligible.
But, no doubt, the note, now concealed
inside his shirt bosom, would clear that
up ; and the next step was to hand it over to
him for whom it was intended.

Luckily, Rivas had not been unobservant
of what was going on between the girl and his
companion. Her look seeming strange to him,

had attracted his attention, and though keeping
steadily at work, his eyes were not on it,
but on them, which resulted in his witnessing
the latter part of the little episode, and having
more than a suspicion it also concerned
himself. He was not taken by surprise,
therefore, when Kearney drawing closer to the
edge of the drain, spoke down to him in a
half-whisper —

I've got something for you. Bring the
point of your tool against mine, and look out
when you feel my fingers."

Muy Men ! I understand," was the muttered
response. In a second or two after the
shafts of their implements came into collision
accidentally, it appeared. He would have
been indeed sharp-witted who could have
supposed it intentional, and lynx-eyed to have
seen that scrap of twisted paper passed from
one to the other — the second transfer dexterously

done as the first. All any one could
have told was, that the two scavengers seemed
sorry for what had occurred, made mutual
apologies, then separated to the full length of
their coupling chain, and went to work again,
looking meek and innocent as lambs.

It was now Eivas' turn to prove himself
possessed of quick wit. He had reason to
think the letter required immediate reading ;
and how was this to be done ? To be seen at
it would surely bring the sentries upon him,
even though Dominguez was not there. And
for them to get possession of it — that was a
calamity perhaps worst of all ! Possibly to
compromise the writer; and well knew he who
that was.

For a time he was perplexed, looking in all
directions, and thinking of every way possible
for him to read the letter unobserved. But
none did seem possible. He could stoop

down, so as to be unseen by those passing
along the sidewalk ; but close to the sewers
edge were two or three of the sentries, who
would still command view of him.

All at once a look of satisfaction came over
his countenance, as his eyes rested on a side
drain, which entered the main one, like many
others, from the adjacent dwellings. He had
just scraped the mud out of its mouth, and
was close to it.

The very thing, was his thought — the very
place for his purpose. And shortly after he
might have been seen standing before it, in
bent attitude, his arms busy with his shovel,
but his eyes and thoughts busier with a sheet
of paper which lay at the bottom of the branch
drain, some two or three feet inside it. It
was the billetita and though the creases were
but hastily pressed out, he contrived to make
himself master of its contents. They were

but brief and legibly written — the script
familiar to him.

Queries, — Soon after receiving this — say,
half-an-hour — look for a carriage — landau shut
up — two ladies inside — pair of large horses —
prisoner — grey. When opposite, be ready —
with him who shares your chain. Leave
manners in the mud, make a rush, storm the
carriage, eject the occupants rudely — violently
and take their places. You can trust the
cicero. Some danger in the attempt, I
know ; but more if not made. Your old
enemy implacable — determined to have your
life. Do this, dearest and save it — for your
country's sake, as also that of

Isabel."

LOOKING OUT FOR A LANDAU.

EOM the way Rivas treated the
"billetita" after he had finished
reading it, one unacquainted with
its contents might have supposed they had
made him either mad angry, or madly jealous.
Instead of taking it up tenderly, and treasuring
it away, he planted his muddy boot upon
it, with a back scrape brought it into the main
sewer, still keeping it under the mud and

trampling it with both feet, lifted and set
down alternately, the while shovelling away,
as though he had forgotten all about it. Not
so, however. The tread-mill action was
neither accidental nor involuntary, but for a
purpose. The writer had committed herself
in designing a portion of her name, as by
other particulars, and should the letter fall
into hands he knew of, her danger would be as
great as his own.

In a few seconds, however, any uneasiness
about this was at an end. The most curious
chiffonier could not have deciphered a word
written on that sheet, which by the churning
he had submitted it to must have been reduced
to a very pulp.

During all this time no one had taken
notice of his proceedings, not even the man
chained to him, except by an occasional side
glance. For Kearney, well aware of what he

was at, to draw attention from him had got up
a word 7 demonstration with the dwarf — to all
appearance a quarrel. There was real anger
on the side of the latter ; for the " gringo," ashe
contemptuously called the Irishman, had
cruelly mocked his deformity. A cruelty
which gave pain to the mocker himself; but
he could think of no other way to secure
inattention to Eivas, and this efficiently did.
Both talking the tongue of the country, their
war of words, with some grotesque gestures
which Kearney affected, engrossed the attention
of all within sight or hearing ; so that not
an eye was left for the surreptitious reader of
the letter.

When the sham quarrel came to an end —
which it did soon as he who commenced it saw
it should — the knot of spectators it had drawn
around dispersed, leaving things as before.
But not as before felt Eivas and Kearney.

Very different now the thoughts stirring
within them, both trying to appear calm while
under the greatest agitation. For they had
again contrived to bring their ears together,
and the latter now knew all about the contents
of the Condesa's letter, their purport being
fully explained, nor did they draw apart, till a
thorough understanding had been established
between them as to the action they should take.
All this without loss of time was translated
to Cris Kock, who was told also of
their resolve to attempt to escape, in which
the Texan was but too glad to take part.
Kearney would have stayed there, and
gone back into the Acordada, loathsome jail
though it was, sooner than leave his old
fluttering comrade behind. He could
never forget the incident of El Salado, nor
cease to feel gratitude to the man who had
offered to give up life for him.

But there was no need for Rock being
left behind. Eivas himself wished it otherwise,
for more than one reason ; but one
good one, that instead of obstructing their
escape he would be an aid to it.

The hunchback alone was not let into
their secret. No doubt he too would be
glad to get free from his chains, since he
was under a sentence of imprisonment for
life. But who could tell whether at the
last moment he might not purchase pardon
by turning out and betraying them ? They
knew him to be vile enough even for that,
and so kept him in the dark about their
design.

There was no need for further premeditation
or contrivance of plans. That had
all been traced out for them in the singular
epistle signed " Ysabel " and a few whispered
words from one to the other completed the

understanding of it, with what was to be
done. From the time this was settled
out, never looked three pair of eyes more
eagerly along a street, than did theirs along
the Calle de Plateros, never was a carriage
more anxiously awaited than a landau which
should show itself with hood up, drawn by
a pair of grey horses.

It is now well on the afternoon, and
the " beauty and fashion" of the Mexican
metropolis were beginning to appear in
carriages, with chivalry on horseback, along
the line of streets leading to the Paseo
Nuevo. The procession of the morning
would little affect the usual evening display ;
and already several equipages had rolled past
the place where the chain-gang was at work.
But as yet appeared not the one so anxiously
looked for, and the half-hour was up !

Still ten minutes more without any sign
of it!

More anxious now were the three prisoners,
who contemplated escape, though
not at all to the same degree, or for the
same reason. Kearney feared there had
been a failure, from betrayal by the coachman
spoken of as so trustworthy ; he did
not think of suspecting Pepita, The Texan,
too, believed some hitch had occurred, a
"bit o' crooked luck" as he worded it.
Not so Eivas. Though, as the others,
chafing at the delay, he still had confidence
in the carriage coming, as he had in the
directing head of one he expected to see
inside it. It was being purposely kept
back, he fancied ; likely as not, lest it
might attract attention by being too early
on the street.

Whatever the cause, his conjectures were

soon brought to an end — and abruptly —
by seeing the thing itself.

Bueno ! " he mentally exclaimed, then
muttering to the others — "Yonder it
comes ! Prisoner partes coachman in sky
blue and silver — be ready cataracts.' "

And ready they were, as panthers preparing
to spring. Kock and Eivas, as Kearney
himself, were now out of the sewer and upon
the street ; all three still making believe
to work ; while the dwarf seemed to suspect
there was something in the wind, but could
not guess what.

He knew the instant after, when a strong
hand, grasping him by the collar, lifted him
off his feet, raising and tossing him further
aloft, as though he had been but a rat.

A CLUMSY COCHEKO

EEHAPS no people in the world
have been more accustomed to
spectacular surprises than they
who perambulate the streets of the Mexican
metropolis. For the half-century preceding
the time of which I write, they had witnessed
almost as many revolutions as years,
seen blood spilled till the stones ran red
with it, and dead bodies lying before their

doors often for hours, even days, unremoved.

As a consequence they are less prone to

curiosity than the dwellers in European

cities, and the spectacle or incident that will

stir their interest in any great degree must

needs be of an uncommon kind.

Eare enough was that they were calledon

to witness now — such of them as chanced

to be sauntering along the Calle de Plateros,

where the chain-gang was at work. They first

saw a carriage — a handsome equipage of the

landau speciality — drawn by a pair of showy

horses, and driven by a coachman in smart

livery, his hat cockaded, proclaiming the

owner of the turn-out as belonging to the

military or diplomatic service. Only ladies,

however, were in it — two of them — and the

horses proceeding at a rather leisurely pace.

As several other carriages with ladies m

them, and liveried coachmen on the boxes,
2—6

had passed before, and some seen coming
behind, there was nothing about this one to
attract particular attention ; unless, indeed,
the beauty of the two " senoritas " inside,
which was certainly exceptional. Both were
young, and, if related, not likely to be sisters ;
in contour of features, complexion, colour of
eyes and hair, everything different, even to
contrast. But alike in that, each after her
own style was a picture of feminine loveliness
of the most piquantly attractive kind ;
while their juxtaposition made it all the
more so, for they were seated side by side.

Such could not fail to draw the eyes of
the street passengers upon them, and elicit
looks of admiration. So far from courting
this, however, they seemed desirous of shunning
it. The day was one of the finest, the
atmosphere deliciously enjoyable, neither too
warm nor too cold ; other carriages were

open, yet the hoods of theirs met overhead,
and the glasses were up. Still, as these
were not curtained they could be seen
through them. Some saw who knew them,
and saluted ; gentlemen by raising the hat,
lady acquaintances by a nod, a quivering of
the fingers. For it was the hour of promenade
to the Alameda. Others to whom
they were unknown inquired whose carriage
it was. But not a few noticed in the faces
of its fair occupants an expression which
struck them as singular ; something of constraint
or anxiety — the last so unlike what
should have been there.

And so all along the line of street, until
the carriage came nearly opposite the entrance
gate of the Alameda, still going slowly ; at
which the pampered, high-spirited horses
seemed to chafe and fret. Just then, however,
they showed a determination to change

the pace, or at all events the direction, by
making a sudden start and shy to the right ;
which carried the off wheels nearly nave-deep
into the ridge of mud recently thrown out
of the sewer.

Instinctively, or mechanically, the coachman
pulled up. No one could suppose
designedly ; since there was sufficient likelihood
of his having an overturn. Still, as
the mud was soft, by bearing on the near
rein, with a sharp cut of the whip, he might
easily clear the obstruction.

This was not done ; and the spectators
wondered why it was not. They had already
made up their minds, that the balk was
due to the coachman's maladroit driving,
and this further proof of his stupidity quite
exhausted their patience. Shouts assailed
him from all sides, jeers, and angry ejaculations.


Burro ! " (donkey) exclaimed one ; a
second crying out. rt What a clumsy cocker v ! "
a third, "You're a nice fellow to be trusted
with reins ! A rope tied to a pig's tail would
better become you ?"

Other like shafts, equally envenomed, were
hurled at Jose's head ; for it scarce needs
telling that he was the driver of the carriage,
and the ladies inside it his mistress and the
Condesa Almonte. For all, he seemed but
little to regard what was being said to him
indeed nothing, having enough on hand
with his restive horses. But why did he
not give them the whip, and let them have
more rein ! It looked as if that would start
them off all right again, and that was what
every one was shouting to him to do, he
instead doing the very opposite, holding the
animals in till they commenced plunging.

The ladies looked sorely affrighted ; they

had from the first, for it was all but the
occurrence of an instant, Both had risen
to their feet, one tugging at the strap to get
the sash down, the other working at the
handle of the door, which perversely refused
to act, all the while uttering cries of alarm.
Several of the passengers rushed to the
door in the near side to assist them, that on
the off being unapproachable by reason of
the open drain. But on this also appeared
rescuers — a pair of them — not street promenaders.
but taro of the chain-gang ! All
muddy as these were, they were advancing
with as much apparent eagerness as the others
more in reality — to release the imperilled
senoritas. A proof that humanity may exist
even in the breast of a jail-bird ; and the
spectators, pleased with an exhibition of it,
so rare and unexpected, were preparing to
applaud them enthusiastically.

Their admiration, however, received a rude
and almost instantaneous check, changing to
wild astonishment, succeeded by equally wild
indignation. The forzados got their door
open first ; but the ladies, apparently terrified
at the rough, unclean creatures, refused to go
out that way, and only shrank back. Luckily,
the other was by this also opened, and they
made through it into the street. But not
before the two scavengers had leaped up into
the carriage beside them, and, as if angry at
their earlier offer being declined, given them a
rude shove outward !

That was not all the spectators saw to
astonish them. Other incidents followed
equally unlooked for, and with lightning
rapidity. One was indeed of simultaneous
occurrence ; a second couple of the scavengers
— the gigantic y enano — rushing towards
the coachman's box, clambering up to it,

Rock flinging the dwarf before him, as one
would an old carpet-bag, and mounting after.
Then, jerking the reins and whip out of Jose's
hands — letting him still keep his seat, however,
— he loosened the one, and laid the lash
of the other on the horses' hips, so sharply
and vigorously, as to start them at once into
a gallop.

Meanwhile, the uncouth couple inside had
pulled to the doors, shutting themselves in,
and taken the seats late occupied by the
elegantly dressed ladies — a transformation so
grotesque as to seem more dream than reality.
And so off all went, leaving behind a crowd
as much amazed as any that ever witnessed
spectacle on the streets of the Mexican
metropolis.

THE Poor LADIES.

Lite a combination of circumstances
had favoured the escape
of the four forzaclos — the balking
of the horses, the absence of ,
and the relaxed vigilance of the
guards — from their brains muddled with
drink. But there was yet another lucky
chance that stood them in stead — the point
from which they had started. The line of

sentries ended at the Alamedas gate, and,
as the one posted there was he who had
them in particular charge, once past him
they had only to fear a single bullet sent
after them.

As it turned out they did not even get
that, fortune favouring them in every way.
This sentry, though last on the line outward,
was the first encountered by the
people returning from the ceremony at San
Cosme ; therefore made most of by passing
friends, with the bottle oftener presented
to his lips. As a consequence when the
carriage whirled past him he had but an
indistinct idea of why it was going so
fast, and none at all as to who were in
it. With eyes drowned in aguardiente he
stood as one dazed looking after, but taking
no measures to stop it. When at
length some one bawled the truth into his

ear and lie brought his flint-lock to an
unsteady level, it would have been too
late — had the piece gone off. Luckily for
those on the sidewalk, it did not ; missing
fire by a flash in the pan, as might have
been anticipated.

Never were sentries more completely taken
by surprise than they guarding the chain
gang. Nor more disagreeably. They knew
they had been neglecting their duty, and
might expect severe punishment ! possibly
set at the very task they were now superintending
! Still they made no attempt
to pursue. They were not cavalry ; and
only mounted men could overtake that
landau with its curious load, soon to vanish
from their sight. So they stood gazing
after it in helpless bewilderment, their faces
showing a variety of expressions, surprise,
anger, fear, mingled in a most ludicrous

manner. Deserting their posts they had
gathered into a knot, and it was sometime
before they had so far recovered their senses
as to think of despatching one of their
number to the Plaza Grande after cavalry
sure to be there.

It was a fine opportunity for others of
the gaol-birds to make a bolt; but for the
obstructive coupling-chains no doubt some
would have availed themselves of it. These,
however, hindered the attempt. There were
no more restive horses, nor blundering coachmen
to bring another carriage near enough
for a rush.

But the most interesting group now on
the ground was that which had collected
around the ladies left carriageless ; some
offering services, others speaking words of
sympathy. " Las senoritas pores ! " Pores
— (the poor young ladies!" "Poor

things ! ") were exclamations uttered over andover
again.

It was a trying situation for the " poor
things " to be in sure enough. But they
acquitted themselves admirably ; especially
the Condesa, who, young though she was, for
courage and coolness had few to equal her.
In that emergency no man could have shown
himself her superior. Her look of still tranquillized
terror, the intermittent flashes of
anger in her eyes as she loudly denounced the
ruffians who had carried off their carriage, was
a piece of acting worthy of a Rachel or Siddons.
He would have been a keen physiognomist
who could have told that her
emotions were counterfeit. Little dreamt
the sympathising spectators that while being
pushed out of the carriage she had contrived
to whisper back to the man so
rudely behaving ; " Look under the cushions,

queries ! You'll find something. Dios te
guard !

Still less could they have supposed that the
other young lady, looking so meek, had at the
same time spoken tender words to the second
ruffian who had assailed them.

The part the pobrecitas were playing with
the sympathy they received, seemed to themselves
so comically ludicrous that, but for its
serious side, neither could have kept countenance.
Alone, the thought of the lovers not
yet being beyond danger hindered their
bursting out into laughter.

And lest this, too, might cease to restrain
them they seized upon the earliest pretext to
get away from the spot.

Glad were they when some of their gentlemen
acquaintances, who chanced to be passing
the place, came up and proposed escorting
them home. A service accepted and, it need

not be said, offered with as much alacrity as
it was received.

Their departure had no effect in dispersing
the crowd which had gathered by the Alameda's
gate. A spot signalised by an episode,
so odd and original, was not to be forsaken in
that quick inconsiderate way. Instead, the
throng grew quicker, until the street for a
long stretch was packed full of people, close
as they could stand. Only one part of it
remained unoccupied, the central list, showing
the open sewer with its bordering of black
mud. In their holiday attire the populace
declined invading this, though they stood
wedging one another along its edge ; their
faces turned towards it, with hilarity in their
looks and laughter on their lips. It was just
the sort of spectacle to please them ; the
sentries in a row — for they had now sneaked
back to their post — appearing terribly crestfallen,

while those over whom they stood guard
seemed, on the contrary cheerful — as though
expecting soon to be released from their chains.
With them it was the esprit de corps of the
galley slave, glad to see a comrade escape from
their common misery, though he cannot escape
himself.

All this, however, was tame ; but the winding
up of the spectacle in a quiet natural way.
It would soon have been over now, and the
sight seers scattered off to their homes, but
just as they were beginning to retire a new
incident claimed their attention. A scene
almost as exciting as any that had preceded,
though only a single personage appeared in it.
This Dominguez, the gaoler, who had been
absent all the while at his pit queria, and
only just warned of the event that had so
convulsed the Calle de Plateros, breaking
through the crowd like an enraged bull, rushed

along the sewer's edge, flourishing his whip
over the heads of the forzados, at the same
time reviling the sentries for their scandalous
neglect of duty ? To tell the truth he was
more troubled about his own. He had received
particular instructions to be watchful of four
prisoners — the very ones that had escaped.
Well might he dread the reckoning in store
for him on return to the gaol. However could
he face his governor ?

For some time he strode to and fro, venting
his drunken spleen alike on soldiers or
scavengers. Some of the former would have
retaliated ; but they knew him to have
authority in high places, and therefore kept
silent, sullenly enduring it. Not so the
spectators, many of whom, knowing, hated
him. Possibly, more than probably, some of
them had been under his care. But to all
he was now affording infinite amusement.
2—7

They laughed at his impotent anger, and
laughed again, one crying out, " He's as
good as a bull in the ring ! " another exclaiming,
" Viva el Senor Dominguez rey de
las bastoneros/" (hurrah for the Senor
Dominguez, king of the turnkeys ! ") — a sally
which elicited roars of applauding laughter.

If angry before he was now infuriated.
Purple in the face, he was making a dash
at the man whom he suspected of mocking
him, when his foot slipped and down he went
into the drain head foremost.

He had altogether disappeared, and was
for some seconds out of sight ; the laughter
which had become a yelling chorus, all the
while continuing. Nor did it cease when he
re-appeared ; instead, was louder and more
uproarious than ever. For his face, late blue
with rage, was now black with a limning of
the sewer liquid.

But he was less mad than sad, after the
ill-timed tumble. The douche had tamed,
if not sobered him ; and his only thought
now was how to get away from that place of
repeated discomfitures, anywhere to hide and
wash himself.

Luck declared for him at last, in the
approach of a squadron of hussars, drawing
off from him the eyes of the spectators ; who
had now enough to do looking out for themselves
and their safety. For the hussars
were coming on at a gallop, with drawn
sabres.

A crush and a scampering followed, as they
forced their way through the crowd, shouting,
and striking with the back of their blades.
After they had passed, the people were no
longer in a humour for laughing at the " King
of the turnkeys," nor any one else ; neither
was he there to be laughed at.

A TRANSFORMATION".

HILE the ladies set clown upon the
street were still plaintively appealing
to those around, the carriage
from which they had been so unceremoniously
ejected was tearing along the Calle che San
Francisco, going direct for the Acorclacla !
But nothing could be farther from the
thoughts of those in it than a return to that
grand gaol, or even approaching its door. All

of them knew there was a regular guard
there ; and instead of a single musket missing
fire, they would more likely be saluted with
a full volley, sending a shower of bullets
about their ears. Bad marksmen as the
Mexican soldiers are, they could not all miss.
But even if they passed through that unscathed,
beyond was the garita of San Cosme,
with another guard there. Indeed, go what
way they would, there was none leading out
into the country without a garita to be got
through — and for the country they were aiming.


In these gates, however, there was a difference
as to the strength of their guard detail,
and the possibilities of their being passed.
All of which one of the fugitives well understood
— Eivas, who, as a matter of course, had
assumed direction of everything relating to
their flight. "When opposite the old convent,

which gives its name to the street, he leaned
his head out of the carriage window, and said
to the cicero :

Take the route by El Nino Perdido. You
know the way ; show it to him."

The " him " was Cris Rock, who still had
hold of the reins, and who not understanding
Spanish, could not be addressed direct.

The result of the order was, that shortly
after, the horses were headed into a side
street, indicated to the Texan, by a nod perceptible
only to himself. It would not do for
the real coachman to appear as aiding their
escape ; though there was no danger of the
dwarf, observing it — the latter having been
crammed down into the box-boot, where he
was held with his head between Bock's huge
thighs, as in a vice.

The street into which they had turned was
a narrow one running along; a dead wall — that

of the ancient monastery, which occupies acres
of ground. And in its strip of side walk just
then there was not a pedestrian to be seen —
the very thing Kivas had been wishing for.
Again speaking out, he said : —

Slowly for a bit. I see a serape out there.
Tell the Tejanos to put it on."

For the next hundred yards or so — along
the dead wall — the horses went at a walk,
they inside the carriage, as also one on the
box, all the while busy as bees. And when
they came out at the end of the quiet street
entering upon a more frequented thoroughfare,
the brisk pace was resumed ; though no one
could have believed it the same party, seen buta
minute or two before driving at a racecourse
speed along the Calle de Plateros. Jose alone
looked the same, in his sky-blue livery and
cockaded hat. But the big man by his side
had so far effected a change that his mud stained

habiliments were hidden under an ample
serape, which covered him from neck to
ancles ; while the little one was altogether invisible,
and under a threat of having his skull
kicked in if he attempted to show himself.

Alike quick and complete had been the
transformation of the " insides ". There now
sat two gentlemen, decently, indeed rather
stylish dressed — one wearing a blue cloth
cloak, with velvet collar ; the other a scarlet
manna," with gold bullion embroidery from
neck to shoulders.

About the equipage there was little now to
make remark upon, or cause it to be regarded
with suspicion. Some rich hacienda, who
had been at the laying of the foundation-stone,
on return to his country house, taking a friend
along with him. The strapping fellow on the
box might be mayor-domo of the estate — they
are usually tall men — who had taken a fancy

to try his hand at driving, and the coachman
had surrendered him the reins. All perfectly
natural, and en regie, even to the rapid speed
at which the horses were put. The driver not
accustomed to handling the ribbons would
account for this. Besides, the sun was getting
low, the casa de campo might be a good distance
from town, and such a splendid turn out,
belated on a country road would be like tempting
( Providence, and certainly the scdtea-
doves !

How little would its occupants have regarded
an encounter with highwaymen. Perhaps
just then they would have welcomed it. Nor
much did Eivas anticipate further trouble in
the streets of the city. He was familiar with
those they were now driving along, and felt
no fear of being obstructed there — at least by
the people. Had they hung their chain out
of the carriage window and exposed the prison

dress, no one in that quarter would have cried
Stop thief ! " The man who should so cry,
would run the risk of having his clamour
suddenly silenced.

For all they had apprehensions of the
keenest. If they were in no danger while in
the streets, they would be when parting from
them — at El Nino Perdido. That gauntlet
had yet to be run.

But while thinking of it, they had not been
idle, instead all the while planning and preparing
for it ; Eivas instructing the others as
to how they should act.

A garita of the usual kind," he said to
Kearney, making known the nature of the
anticipated obstruction ; " a gate across the
road, with a guard house alongside. There's
sure to be a sergeant and eight or ten files in
it. If, by good luck the gate be open, our
best way will be to approach gently, then go

through at a gallop. If shut, we'll be called
upon to show our best diplomacy. Leave all
that to me. Failing to fool the guard we must
do battle with it. Anything' s better than betaken
back to the Acordada, That would be
sure death for me ; and, if I mistake not, for
yourself, Senor."

I'm sure of it. If we can't get through
without, let us fight our way, whatever the
result,"

Take this pair, then. They seem the most
reliable. You Americans are more skilled in
the use of fire-arms than we. With us steel
is preferred. But I'll do the best I can with
the other pair."

This had reference to two pairs of pistols
discovered under the carriage cushions. Nor
were they the only weapons there ; besides
them were two long-bladed knives, and a pearl
handed stiletto — the last a tiny affair, which

looked as though taken from the toilet case of
a lady.

See that yours are loaded and in firing
order," Eivas added, at the same time looking
to his own.

The injunction was not needed, as the Irishman
was already examining the weapons put
into his hand, with a view to their efficiency.

Both pair of pistols were of the old-fashioned
duelling kind — flint locks, with barrels nearly
a foot in length. Like as not the Condesa's
father, and Don Ignacio Valverde, in days long
gone bye, had vindicated honour with them.

The inspection was quick and short, as had
been all that preceded ; pans sprung open,
showing them filled with powder ; rammers
run into the barrels, then drawn out again,
and replaced in their thimbles.

Mine," said Kearney, first to report, " are
good for two lives."

And mine the same," rejoined Kivas,
unless I'm laid low before I can pull the
second trigger. Now to dispose of the knives.
My countryman, the cocker v, however, trustworthy,
mustn't show fight. That would
ruin all afterwards. But, if I mistake not,
your colossal comrade is the man to make
play with one of them in a pinch. "

You may be sure of it. He was in the
Alamo with Bowie, and at Goliath with Fanning.
Don't fear putting a knife into his
hands ; he'll make good use of it if we're
driven to close quarters."

Let him have it, then. You give it, and
tel him all."

Kearney getting hold of one of the two
knives, that seeming best suited for the hands
he designed putting it in, passed it on to Cris
Rock. Not through the carriage window, buta
hole cut in the leathern hood by the blade

itself. Speaking through the same, he
said : —

Cris ! we've got to run a gate where
there's a guard of soldiers — may be a dozen
or so. You're to drive gently up, and, if you
see it open, pass through — then lay on the
whip. Should it be shut approach more
briskly, and pull up impatient-like. But do
nothing of yourself — wait till I give you the
word."

Trust me, cap. ; ye kin do that, I kilk'late."

I can, Cris. Take this knife, and if you
hear pistols cracking behind, you'll then know
what to do with it."

I'll gie a guess, anyhow," rejoined the
Texan, taking hold of the knife, in a hand
passed behind him. Then bringing it forward
and under his eyes, he added, " 'Taint sech a
bad sort o' blade either, tho' I welsh 'twas
my ole bowie they took from me at Miner.

Wal, cap. ; ye kin count on me making' use
o't, ef carson calls, an' modern one callers
gittin it inter his guts ; notwithstanding'
this duration clog that's swinging' at my legs.
By the jumping' Geehosophat, if I ked only

git she o' that I'd "

"What he would do or intended saying, had
to stay unsaid. Rivas interrupted him, pulling
Kearney back, and telling him to be ready
with the pistols. For they were nearing the
place of danger.

AX Unlooked FOR SALUTE.

N a strict military sense the capital
of Mexico cannot be called a fortified
city. Still it has defences, one
being an enceinte wall, which envelops it all
round, leaving no straggled suburb, scarce so
much as a house outside. Compact and close
stand the dwellings of the modern city as
those of ancient Tenochtitlan, whose site it
occupies, though the waves of Tezcuco and
Xochimilco no longer lap up to its walls.

The enceinte spoken of is a mere structure
of "adobes," large sun-baked blocks of mud
and straw, — in short the bricks of the Egyptians,
whose making so vexed Moses and the
Israelites. Here and there may be seen a
little redoubt, with a battery of guns in it ;
but only on revolutionary occasions — the wall,
so far as defence goes, more concerning the
smuggler than the soldier. And less contraband
from abroad than infringement of certain
regulations of home commerce — chief of them
the tax called " alabama," corresponding to
the octroi of France, and the corvee of some
other European countries.

The tax is collected at the " veritas " of

which there is one on every road leading out

of the city, or rather into it ; for it is the

man who enters, not he making exit, who is

called upon to contribute to the alabama.

It is levied on every article or commodity
2—8

brought from the country in search of a city
market. Nothing escapes it ; the produce of
farm and garden, field and forest — all have
to pay toll at the veritas, so losing a considerable
percentage of their value. The
brown aboriginal, his " burro " laden with
charcoal, or skins of pulque, or himself staggering
under a load of planks heavy enough
to weigh down a donkey, which he has transported
from a mountain forest — ten or twenty
miles it may be — is mulcted in this blackmail
before he can pass through a garita.

Not unfrequently he is unable to meet the
demand till he have made sale of the taxed
commodity. On such occasions he hypothecates
his hat, or grenada, leaving it at the
gate, and going on bareheaded, or bare-shouldered,
to the market, to redeem the
pawned article on return.

Save through these rates there is no access

to, or egress from, the Mexican capital ; and
at each, besides the official having charge of
the revenue matters, a soldier-guard is stationed,
with a guard-house provided ; their
duties being of a mixed three-cornered kind
customs, police and military. Five or six
such posts there are, on the five or six roads
leading out from the city ; like the radiating
limbs of a star-fish ; and one of these is the
garita, El Nino Perdido — literally the gate
of the "Lost Child". It is, however, one
through which the traffic is of secondary
importance ; since it is not on any of the
main routes of travel. That which it bars is
but a country road, communicating with the
villages of Mixcoac, Coyoacan, and San Angel.
Still, these being places of rural residence,
where some of the familiars principes have
country houses, a carriage passing through
the gate of the Lost Child is no rarity.

Besides, from the gate itself runs a Canada,
or causeway, wide and straight for nearly two
miles, with a double row of grand old trees
along each side whose pleasant shade invites,
and often receives, visits from city excursionists
out for a stroll, ride or drive. Near
the end of the second mile it angles abruptly
to the right, in the direction of San Angel —
a sharp corner, the writer has good reason to
remember, having been shot at by Saltem
luckily missed, while passing round it
on his way from country quarters to the city.
A horse of best blood saved his blood there,
or this tale would never have been told.

Asking the reader's pardon for a personal
digression — with the excuse that it may
throw light on the scene to follow — it will
be understood how easily the guard on duty
at the gate might be " thrown off guard " by
a carriage passing through it ; especially on

that day when there were so marry, by
reasons of the grand doings in the city.

Several had just passed, going country-wards
; for it was the season of rural sojourn
among the "rico". So when another
appeared, heading in the same direction, the
guard sergeant at Nino Perdido saw nothing
amiss, or to be suspicious of ; instead, something
to inspire him with respect. He had been
on guard at the Palace scores of times ; and
by appearance knew all who were accustomed
to pass in and out, more especially those
holding authority. Liveries he could distinguish
at any distance ; and when he saw a
carriage approaching along the street, with a
coachman in sky-blue and silver, cockaded,
he did not need its being near to recognise
the equipage of one of the Cabinet
Ministers.

Though a non-commissioned officer, he was

a man of ambitious aims ; dreaming of gold
bullion in the shape of epaulettes ; and he
had long had his eye on the epaulette of an
altered — officers of this rank being allowed only
one. The good word of a Cabinet Minister,
whether war, navy, or Hacienda, could give
him what he was wishing for, easy at a nod ;
and here was an opportunity of winning it.

Cato ! " he cried out to his corporal, ina
flurry of excitement, " throw open the gate
quick ! Fall in, men ! Dress up — ready
to present arms. See that you do it handsomely
! "

It was in his favour, and so he congratulated
himself, that the carriage came on
rather slowly ; so that he had ample time to
get his • half-dozen files well set-up, and
dressed for the salute.

There was some buttoning of jackets,
stocks to be adjusted round shirtless necks,

with shakos to be searched for inside the
guard-house, and hurriedly clapped on. Still
it was all got through in good time ; and,
when at length the carriage came abreast,
the guard was found standing at " present
arms," the sergeant himself saluting in the
most gracious manner.

They inside, knowing how, returned the
salute in true soldier style, though with a
surprised expression upon their faces. No
wonder. Where they had anticipated difficulty
and danger, they were received with
more than civility — accorded military honours !

IS IT A GEITO?

HE soldiers of the guard had grounded
arms, and were sauntering back
to their benches, when something
came into the sergeant's mind which caused
him misgiving. Was it possible he had
been paying honours to those undeserving
of them ?

He was sure of it being the carriage of
Don Ignacio Valverde ; his horses and livery

too. But nothing more. None of the party
was known to him as belonging to Don
Ignacio's family or servants. For Jose was
but groom or second coachman, who occasionally
drove out his young mistress, but
never to the palace, or other place, where
the sergeant had been on duty.

Equally a stranger to him was the big
fellow on the box who had hold of the
reins, as also one of the gentlemen inside.
It occurred to him, however, that the face
of the other was familiar — awakening the
memories of more than ordinary interest.

"MM diable ! " he muttered to himself
as he stood gazing after the retreating
equipage, " If that wasn't my old captain,
Don Euperto Eivas, there isn't another man
in Mexico more like him. I heard say he
had turned Salvador, and they'd taken him
only the other day. Carrie ! what's that ? ' '

The carriage, as yet not over a hundred
yards from the garita, still going on at a
rather moderate pace, was seen suddenly
to increase its speed : in fact, the horses
had started off at a gallop ! Nor was this
from any scare or fright, but caused by a
sharp cut or two of the whip ; as he could
tell by seeing the arm of the big man on
the box several times raised above the roof,
and vigorously lowered again. Extraordinary
behaviour on his part, how was
it to be accounted for ? And how explain
that of the gentleman inside, who appeared
satisfied with the changed pace ? At all
events they were doing naught to prevent
it, for again and again the whip strokes
were repeated ! None of the party were
intoxicated ; at least they had no appearance
of it when they passed the gate. A
little excited-looking; though no more than

might be expected in men returning from
a public procession. But an elegant light
equipage with horses in full gallop, so
unlike the carriage of a Cabinet Minister !
What the mischief could it mean ?

The guard sergeant had just asked himself
the question, when, hark ! a gun fired
at the Citadel ! Soon after another from
the military college of Chapultepec ! And
from the direction of the Plaza Grande the
ringing of bells ! First those of the
Cathedral, then of the Acordada, and the
convent of San Francisco, with other convents
and churches, till there was a clangour
all over the city !

Hark again ! A second gun from the
citadel, quick followed by another from Chapels
evidently signals and their responses !

What the demon is it ? A pronunciamento
? "

Not only did the sergeant thus interrogate,
but all the soldiers under his command, putting
the question to one another. It would be
nothing much to surprise them, least of all
himself. He was somewhat of a veteran,
and had seen nigh a score of revolutions,
counting mentes.

I shouldn't be surprised if it is," he
suggested, adding as a third gun boomed
out from the Citadel, u It must be a
grit ! "

Who's raising it this time, I wonder ? "
said one of the soldiers, all now in a flurry
of excited expectancy.

Several names of noted military were
mentioned at a venture. But no one
could say for certain, nor even give a guess
with any confidence. They could hardly yet
realise its being the breaking out of a pronunciamento,
since there had been no late

tampering with them — the usual preliminary
to revolutions.

It might not be after all. But they would
be better able to decide should they hear
the rattle of small arms, and for this listened
they all ears.

More than one of them would have been
delighted to hear it. Not that they disliked
the regime of the Dictator nor the man
himself. Like all despots he was the soldier's
friend ; professed and giving proofs of it, by
indulging them in soldierly licence — permission
to lord it over the citizen. But much
as they liked " El Coo " (game leg), as they
called him, a grit would be still more agreeable
to them — promising unlimited loot.

The sergeant had views of his own, and
reflections he kept to himself. He felt good
as sure there was something up, and could not
help connecting it with the carriage which

had just passed. He now no longer doubted
having seen his old captain in it. But how
came he to be there, and what doing ? He
had been in the city that's certain — was now
out of it, and going at a speed that must
mean something more than common. He
could get to San Augustin by that route.
There were troops quartered there. Had they
declared for the Liberals ?

It might be so, and Kivas was on his way
to meet and lead them on to the city. At
any moment they might appear on the canada,
at the corner round which the carriage had
just turned.

The sergeant was now in a state of nervous
perplexity. Although his eyes were on the
road his thoughts were not there, but all
turned inward, communing with himself.
Which side ought he to take ? That of the
Liber ales or the Parti Pretre f He had been

upon both through two or three alternate
changes, and still he was but a sargent.
And as he had been serving Santa Anna fora
longer spell than usual, without a single
step of promotion, he could not make much
of a mistake by giving the Republican party
one more trial. It might get him the long-coveted
epaulette of altered.

While still occupied with his ambitious
dreams, endeavouring to decide into which
scale he should throw the weight of his sword,
musket, and bayonet, the citadel gun once
more boomed out, answered by the cannon of
Chapultepec.

Still, there was no cracking of rifles, nor
continuous rattle of musketry, such as should
be heard coincident with that cry which in
the Mexican metropolis usually announces a
change of government.

It seemed strange not only to him, but all

others on guard at El Nino. But it might bea
parley — the calm before the storm, which
they could not help thinking would yet burst
forth, in full fusilade — such as they had been
accustomed to.

Listening on, however, they heard not that ;
only the bells, bells, bells, jingling all over the
city as though it were on fire ; those of the
cathedral leading the orchestra of campanile
music. And yet another gun from the Citadel
with the answering one from the " Summer
Palace of the Montezuma ".

They were fast losing patience, beginning
to fear there would be no pronunciamento
after all, and no chance of plundering, when
the notes of a cavalry bugle broke upon their
ears.

At last ! " cried one, speaking the mind of
all, and as though the sound were a relief to
them. " That's the beginning of it. So,

cataracts ! we may get ready. The next
thing will be the cracking of carbines ! "

They all ran to the stack of muskets, each
clutching at his own. They stood listening as
before ; but not to hear any cracking of
carbines. Instead, the bugle again brayed
out its trumpet notes, recognisable as signals
of command ; which, though only infantry
men, they understood. There was the " Quick
march ! " and " Double quick ! " but they had
no time to reflect on what it was for, nor need,
as just then a troop of hussars was seen defiling
out from a side street, and coming on towards
them at a charging gallop.

In a few seconds they were up to the gate,
which, being still open, they could have passed
through, without stop or parley. For all,
they made both, the commanding officer suddenly
reining up, and shouting back along

the line :

2—9

Alto ! "

The " halt " was proclaimed by the trumpeter
at his side, which brought the galloping
cohort to a stand.

Sargent /" thundered he at their head
to the guard-sergeant who, with his men
re-formed, was again at " Present arms," " hasa
carriage passed you, guard — a landau — grey
horses — five men in it ? "

Only four men, Senor Colonel. But all
the rest as you describe it."

Only four ! What can that mean ? Was
there a coachman in light blue livery — silver
facings ? "

The same, Senor Colonel."

That's it, sure ; must be. How long since
it passed ? "

Not quite twenty minutes, Senor Colonel.
It's just gone round the corner ; yonder where
you see the dust stirring."

Adeline ! *' cried the colonel, without
waiting to question further, and as the trumpet
gave out the " Forward — gallop ! " the hussar
troop went sweeping through the gate, leaving
the guard-sergeant and his men in a state of
great mystification and no little chagrin ; he,
their chief spokesman, saying with a sorrowful
air ;

Well, honores ! It don't look like a grit,
after all ! "

AN Ill-used COACHMAN.

Such forethought V exclaimed Eivas,
as the landau went rattling along
the road with the speed of a war-chariot,
" Wonderful !" he went on. " Ah,
for cleverness, commend me to a woman —
when her will's in it. We men are but
simpletons to them. My glorious Ysabel.
She's the sort for a soldiers wife. But

don't let me be claiming all the credit for

her. Fair play to the Senorita Valverde ; who
has, I doubt not, done her share of the contriving
— on your account, Senor."

The Senor so spoken to had no doubt of it
either, and would have been grieved to think
otherwise, but he was too busy at the moment
to say much, and only signified his assent in
monosyllables. With head down, and arms in
see sawing motion — he was endeavouring to
cut their coupling chain ; the tool he handled
being a large file ; another of the " something "
to be found under the cushions — as found it
was ! No wonder Don Rupert's enthusiastic
admiration of the providence which had placed
it there.

Handy with workmen's tools as with warlike
weapons, the young Irishman had laid hold
of it as soon as they were safe through the
garita, and was now rasping away with might
and main ; the other keeping the chain in place.

It was not a task to be accomplished
without time. The links were thick as a
man's finger, and would need no end of filing
before they could be parted. Still, there was
little likelihood of their being interrupted
until it could be done. There was nobody on
the road, and only here and there some
labourers at work in the adjoining fields, too
busy to take note of them, or what they were
at. The sight of a passing carriage would be
nothing strange, and the horses going at a
gallop would but lead to the supposition of its
being a party of "jones dorado" driving
out into the country who had taken too much
wine before starting.

But even though these poor politicians
knew all, there was nothing to be apprehended
for any action on their part. Conspiracies and
pronunciamentos were not in their line ; and
the storm of revolution might burst over their

heads without their caring what way it went,
or even enquiring who was its promoter. So
the escaping prisoners took little pains to conceal
what they were at. Speed was now more
to their purpose than strategy, and they were
making their best of it, both to get on along
the road, and have their legs free for future
action.

We might have passed safely through that
gate," said the Mexican, who still continued
to do the talking, " even had they known
who we were."

Indeed ! how ?"

You saw that sergeant who saluted us ?"

Of course I did, and the grand salute he
gave ! He couldn't have made it more impressive
had it been the Commander-in-chief
of your army, or the Dictator himself who was
passing."

"And I fancy it was just something of

the kind that moved him. Doubtless, the
livery of the coachman which he would
know to be that of Don Ignacio Valverde."

You think he got us through ? "

Yes. But it wouldn't have done so if
he'd known what was up. Though something
else might — that is his knowing me."

Oh ! he knows you ? "

He does ; though I'm not sure he recognised
me in passing, as I did him. Odd
enough, his being there just then. He was
corporal in a company I once commanded,
and I believe liked me as his captain. He's
an old schemer, though ; has turned his
coat times beyond counting ; and just as
well there's been no call for trusting him.
He'll catch it for letting us slip past without
challenge ; and serve him right, wearing
the colours he now does. Ha ! they've
waked up at last ! I was expecting that."

It was the first gun at the Citadel which
called forth these exclamations, soon followed
by the ding-dong of the city bells.

Carrai /" he continued, " we're no doubt
being pursued now, and by cavalry ; some
of those we saw in the Procession. It begins
to look bad. Still, with so much start,
and this fine pair of prisoner, I've not much
fear of their overtaking us, till we reach the
point I'm making for ; unless, indeed "

Unless what ? " asked Kearney, seeing
he had interrupted himself, and was looking
out apprehensively.

That ! There's your answer," said the
Mexican, pointing to a puff of smoke that
had just shot out from the summit of an
isolated hill on which were batteries and
buildings ; " Chapultepec — a gun!" he added,
and the bang came instantly after.

We'll have it hot enough now," he continued,

in a tone telling of alarm. " There's
sure to be cavalry np yonder. If they're
cleverly led, and know which way to take,
they may head us off yet, in spite of all we
can do. Lay on the whip," he shouted out
to the coachman.

And the whip was laid on, till the horses
galloped faster than ever, leaving behind a
cloud of dust, which extended back for more
than a mile.

The road they were on was the direct
route to San Angel; and through this village
Kivas had intended going, as he had no
reason to believe there were troops stationed
in it. But Chapultepec was nearer to it than
the point where they themselves were, and
cavalry now starting from the latter could
easily reach San Angel before them. But
there was a branch road leading to Coyoacan,
and as that would give them some advantage,
he determined on taking it.

And now another gun at the Citadel, with
the response from Chapultepec, and, soon after,
the third booming from both. But meanwhile,
something seen at the castle-crowned hill
which deepened the anxious expression on the
face of the Mexican.

Santos Dios !" he exclaimed, " just as I
expected. Look yonder, Senor !"

Kearney looked, to see a stream pouring
out from the castle gates and running down
the steep causeway which zig-zags to the
bottom of the hill. A stream of men in
uniform, by their square crowned shakos
and other insignia, recognisable as Lancers.
They had neither weapons nor horses with
them ; but both, as Eivas knew, would beat
the Cartel and stables below. He
also knew that the Lancers were trained
soldiers — a petted arm of the service — and it
would not take them long to "boot and saddle ".

More than ever was his look troubled
now, still not despairing. He had his
hopes and plans.

Drop your file, Senor," he said hurriedly ;
"no time to finish that now. We must
wait for a better opportunity. And we'll
have to leave the carriage behind; but not
just yet."

By this they had arrived at the embouchure
of the branch road coming out from
Cayocaon, into which by his direction the
horses were headed, going on without stop
or slackening of speed. And so for nearly
another mile then he called out to those on
the box to bring up.

Rock anticipating something of the sort,
instantly reined in, and the carriage came
to a stand. At which the two inside
sprang out upon the road, Kearney calling
to the Texan :

Drop the reins, Cris ! Down ; unhitch
the horses. Quick ! "

And quick came he down, jerking the
dwarf after, who fell upon all fours ! as he
recovered his feet, looking as if he had lost
his senses. No one heeded him or his looks ;
the hurry was too great even to stay for
unbuckling.

"Cut everything off!" cried Kearney,
still speaking to Rock. " Leave on only
the bridles."

With the knife late put into his hands
the Texan went to work, Kearney himself
plying the other, while Eivas held the horses
and unhooked the bearing: reins.

Soon pole-pieces and hame-straps were
severed ; and the prisoner led forward left
all behind, save the bridles and collars.

Leave the collars on," said Eivas seeing
there was no time to detach them. " Now,

we mount two and two ; but first to dispose
of him."

The "him" was Jose still seated on the
box, apparently in a state of stupor.

Pull him down, Oris ! Tie him to the
wheel ! " commanded Kearney. " The driving
reins will do it."

The Texan knew how to handle tying
gear, as all Texans do, and in a trice the
unresisting cicero was dragged from his
seat and bound, Ixion-like, to one of the
carriage wheels.

But Rock had not done with him
yet. There was a necessity for something
more which looked like wanton cruelty —
as they wished it to look. This was the
opening of the poor fellow's mouth, and
gagging him with the stock of his own
whip !

So rendered voiceless, and helpless he

saw the four forzados, two-and-two, get
upon his horses and ride off, the only one
who vouchsafed to speak a parting word
being the dwarf — he calling back in a
jocular way :

Adios, Senor cicero ! May your
journey be as pleasant as your coach is slow,
Ha-ha-ha ! "

DOUBLE MOUNTED.

HE labourers hoeing among the young
maize plants, and the tlachiquero
drawing the sap from his magnets,
saw a sight to astonish them. Two horses of
unusual size, both carrying double, and going
at full gallop as if running a race — on one of
them two men in cloaks, blue and scarlet ; the
other ridden by a giant, with a mis-shapen
monkey-like creature clinging on the croup

behind — harness bridles, with collars dancing
loose around their necks — chains hanging down
and clanking at every bound they made — all
this along field paths, in an out-of-the-way
neighbourhood where such horses and such
men had never been seen before ! To the
cultivator of "milpas" and the collector of
aguamiel " it was a sight not only to astonish,
but inspire them with awe, almost causing the
one to drop his hoe, the other his half-filled
hogskin, and take to their heels. But both
being of the pure Aztecs race, long subdued
and submissive, yet still dreaming of a return
to its ancient rule and glories, they might have
believed it their old monarchs Montezuma and
Guatimozin, come back again, or the god
Oatluetzale himself.

In whatever way the spectacle affected them,
they were not permitted long to look upon it.
For the galloping pace was kept up without
2—10

halt or slowing ; the strange-looking horses —
with the men upon their backs, still stranger
to look at — soon entered a chctpparal, which
bordered the maize and maguey fields, and so
passing out of sight.

We're near the end of our ride now," said
Rivas to Kearney, after they had been sometime
threading their way through the thicket,
the horses from necessity going at a walk.
If 'twere not for this ironmongery around
our ankles, I could almost say we're safe.
Unfortunately, where we've got to go the
chains will be a worse impediment than ever.
Carramba ! The file ! Have we forgotten it ? "

No," answered Kearney, drawing it from
under his cloak, and holding it up.

Thoughtful of you, caballero. In the
haste, I had ; and we should have been helpless
without it, or at all events awkwardly fixed.

If we only had time to use it now. But we
haven't — not so much as a minute to spare.
Besides the lances from Chapultepec, there's a
cavalry troop of some kind — hussars I take it,
coming on from the city. While we were
cutting loose from the carriage I fancied I
heard a bugle call in the direction cityward.
Of course, with guns and bells signalling, we
may expect pursuit from every point of the
compass. Had we kept to the roads we'd have
been met somewhere. As it is, if they give us
another ten minutes' grace, I'll take you into
a place where there's not much fear of our
being followed — by mounted men anyhow."

Kearney heard this without comprehending.
Some hiding place, he supposed, known to the
Mexican. It could only mean that. But
where 1 Looking ahead, he saw the mountains
with their sides forest-clad, and there a fugitive
might find concealment. But they were

miles off; and how were they to be reached
by men afoot — to say nothing of the chains —
with cavalry in hue and cry all around them ?
He put the question.

"Don't be impatient, amigo?" said the
Mexican in response ; " you'll soon see the
place I speak of, and that will be better than
any description I could give. It's a labyrinth
which would have delighted Daedalus himself.
Mir a ! You behold it now ! "

He pointed to a facade of rock, grey
rugged, and precipitous, trending right and
left through the chapparal far as they could
see. A cliff, in short, though of no great
elevation; on its crest, growing yuccas, cactus,
and stunted requite trees.

"The Pedregal!" he added, in a cheerful
voice, "and glad am I to see it. I've to
thank old Vulcan or Pluto for making such a
place. It has saved my life once before, and

I trust will do the same now, for all of us.
But we must be quick about it. Adeline ! "

The horses were urged into a final spurt of
speed, and soon after arrived at the base of
the rocky escarpment, which would have
barred them further advance in that direction
had the intention been to take them on. But
it was not.

"We must part from them, now," said
Eivas. " Dismount all !"

All four slipped off together, Rock taking
hold of both bridles, as if he waited to be told
what to do.

We mustn't leave them here," said the
Mexican. "They might neigh, and so guide
our pursuers to the spot. In another hour,
or half that, we needn't care ; it'll be dark
then—"

He interrupted himself, seeming to reflect,
which, the Texan observing, said to Kearney :

He wishes the animals sent off, do he T

"Just that, Cris."

I war thinking , o' the same, myself. The
ground' for a good spell back, hez been hard
as flint, an' we hasn't left much o' trail,
nothing as a set o' bungling' taller-bellies air
like ter take up. As for starting' the horses,
that's easy as fallen' off a log. Let me do 't."

Do it ?"

Take holt o' one then, cap. Unbuckle
the neck strap and pull off the bridle, when
you see me do so wi' t'other. It is a pity
to act cruel to the poor brutes after the service
they've did us ; but thar ain't no help
for 't. Eddy, air ye ?"

Ready !"

The Texan had taken out his knife ; and
in another instant its blade was through the
horse's ear, the bridle jerked off at the same
time. The animal, uttering a terrified snort,

reared up, spun round, and broke away in
frenzied flight through the thorny cha/pparal.
The other, also released, bounded after, both
soon passing out of sight.

Bueno — bravo ! " cried the Mexican admiringly,
relieved of his dilemma. "Now, seniors,
we must continue the march afoot, and overground
that'll need help from our hands, too.
Damon's ! "

Saying which, he took up the bridles, tossed
them over the crest of the cliff; then ascended
himself, helping Kearney. There was no
path ; but some projections of the rock —
ledges, with the stems of cactus plants growing
upon them — made the ascent possible.
The Texan swarmed up after, with hunchback
at his heels ; as he got upon the top, turning
suddenly round, laying hold of the chain, and
with a " Fee up," hoisting the creature feet
foremost !

Another second and they were all out of
sight ; though not a second too soon. For
as they turned their backs upon the cliff
they could hear behind, on the farther edge
of the thicket through which they had passed,
the signal calls of a cavalry bugle.

THE Pedestal.

Interesting as is the Mexican
Valley in a scenic sense, it is
equally so in the geological one ;
perhaps no part of the earth's crust of like
limited area offering greater attractions to
him who would study the lore of the rocks.
There he may witness the action of both
Plutonic and Volcanic forces, not alone in
records of the buried past, but still existing,

and too oft making display of their mighty
power in the earthquake and the burning
mountain.

There also may be observed the opposed
processes of deposition and denudation in the
silting up of great lakes, and the down wearing
of hills by tropical rain storms with the
river torrents resulting from them.

Nor is any portion of this elevated plateau
more attractive to the geologist than that
known as "El Pedregal " ; a tract lying in
its south-western corner, contiguous to the
Cerro de Adjust. whose summit rises over
it to a height of 6,000 feet and 13,000 above
the level of the sea.

It is a field of lava vomited forth from
Adjust itself in ages long past, which, as it
cooled, became rent into fissures and honeycombed
with cavities of every conceivable
shape. Spread over many square miles of

surface it renders this part of the valley
almost impassable. No wheeled vehicle can betaken
across it ; and even the Mexican horse
and mule — both sure-footed as goats —
get through it with difficulty, and only by
one or two known paths. To the pedestrian
it is a task ; and there are places into
which he even cannot penetrate without
scaling cliffs and traversing chasms deep
and dangerous. It bristles with cactus,
zuccas, and other forms of crystalline
vegetation, characteristic of a barren soil.
But there are spots of great fertility —
hollows where the volcanic ashes were deposited
— forming little oases, into which
the honest Indian finds his way for purposes
of cultivation. Others less honest
seek refuge in its caves and coverts, fugitives
from justice and the gaols — not
always criminals, however, for within it

the proscribed patriot and defeated soldier
oft find an asylum.

In the four individuals who had now
entered there was all this variety, if he
who directed their movements was what the
Condesa Almonte described him. In any
case, he appeared familiar with the place
and its ways, saying to Kearney, as they
went on :

No thanks to me for knowing all about
the Pedregal. I was born on its edge ; when
a boy bird-nested and trapped armadillo allover
it. Twisted as this path is, it will take
us to a spot where we needn't fear any
soldiers following us — not this night anyhow.
To-morrow they may, and welcome. "

Their march was continued, but not without
great difficulty, and much exertion of their
strength. They were forced to clamber over
masses of rock, and thread their way through

thickets of cactus, whose spines sharp as
needles lacerated their skins. With the coupling
chains still on, it was all the more difficult
to avoid them.

Luckily, they had not far to go before arriving
at the place where their conductor deemed
it safe to make a stop. About this, there was
nothing particular, more than its being a hollow,
where they could stand upright without
danger of being seen from any of the eminences
around. Descending into it, Eivas
said : —

Now Don Florencio ; you can finish the
little job you were interrupted at, without
much fear of having to knock off again."

At which he raised the chain, and held it
rested on something firmer than the cushion
of a carriage. So placed, the file made better
progress, and in a short time the link was cut
through, letting them walk freely apart.

Callers /" exclaimed the Mexican, assuming
an attitude as if about to propose a
toast, " may our friendship be more difficult
to sever than that chain, and hold us longer
together — for life, I hope."

Kearney would not have been a son of Erin
to refuse reciprocating the pretty compliment,
which he did with all due warmth and readiness.


But his work was not over. Rock and
Zorillo had yet to be uncoupled ; the former,
perhaps, longing to be delivered more than
any of the four. He had conceived a positive
disgust for the hunchback ; though as already
said, less on account of the creature's physical
than moral deformity, of which last he had
ample evidence during the short while they
were together. Nor had it needed for him to
understand what the latter said. A natural
physiognomist, he could read in Zorillo's eyes

the evil disposition of the animal from which
he drew his name.

As Kearney approached him with the file,
the Texan raising his foot, and planting it on
a ledge of rock, said :

Cut through thar, Cap. : the link as air
next to my ankle-clasp."

This was different to what had been done
with the other which had been severed
centrally. It was not intended to take off the
whole of the chains yet. The Mexican said
there was no time for so much filing ; that
must be done when they got further on.

Yer see, Cap." added Rock, giving a
reason for the request. " 'Fore it's all over,
who knows I mayn't need full leg freedom
'ithoot any hamper. So gie the dwarf the hul
o' the chain to carry. He deserve to lev
it, or suthin' else, round his trample 'stead o'
his leg. This chile have been contagious to

the grist o' queer company in his perambulations
round and about ; but never sech as he.
The sight of him air enough to give a nigger
the gut ache."

And in his quaint vernacular he thus rambled
on at the time Kearney was at work, his rude
speech being an appropriate symphony to the
rasping of the file.

He at the other end of the coupling chain
lay squatted along the ground, saying not a
word, but his eyes full of sparkle and mischief,
as those of an enraged rattle-snake. Still
there was fear in his face : for though he could
not tell what was being said, he fancied it was
about himself, and anything but in his favour.
He was with the other three, but not of them;
his conscience told him that. He was in their
way, too ; had been all along, and would be
hereafter. What if they took into their heads
to rid themselves of him in some violent

manner ? They might cut his throat with one
of the knives he had seen them make such
dexterous use of ! Reflecting in this fashion,
no wonder he was apprehensive.

Something was going to be done to him
different from the rest he felt sure. After the
chain had been got apart the other three drew
off to a distance, and stood as if deliberating.
It must be about himself.

And about him it was — the way to dispose
of him.

I hardly know what we're to do with the
little beast," said Eivas. " Leave him here
loose we aren't ; he'd slip back again, good ascertain,
and too soon for our safety. If we tie
him he will cry out, and might be heard.
"We're not far enough away. Riga ! They're
beating up the cover we've just come out of.
Yes ; they're in the chapparal now !"

It was even so, as could be told by the
2—11

occasional call of a bugle sounding skirmish
signals.

Why not tie and gag him too ?" asked
Kearney.

Sure we could do that. But it wouldn't
be safe either. They might find their way
here at once. But if they didn't find it at
all, and no one came along "

Ah ! I see," interrupted the Irishman, as
the inhumanity of the thing became manifest
to him. " He might perish, you mean ?"

Just so. No doubt the wretch deserves it.
From all I've heard of him he does richly.
But we are not his judges, and have no right
to be his executioners."

Sentiments not such as might have been
expected from the lips of a bandit !

No, certainly not," rejoined Kearney,
hastening to signify his approval of them.

What do you think we should do with

him, Rock ?" he added, addressing himself to
the Texan, who quite comprehended the
difficulty.

War Cap. ; 'thud be merciful to knock him
on the head at on't, than leave him to gasp
it out with a stopper in his mouth ; as ye say
the Mexican thinks he shout. But thar ain't
no need for either. Why not that him
along ? Ef he should bother us I kin hist
him on my back, easy enuf. Ugly burden
he'd be, tho' 'taint for the weight o' him."

The Texan's suggestion, was entertained, no
other course seeming safe, except at the probable
sacrifice of the creature's life. And that
none of them contemplated for a moment.
In fine, it was determined to take him on.

The colloquy now coming to an end, Eivas
and the Irishman caught up the pieces of
chain still attached to their ankles, each
making the end of his own fast round his

wrist, so as not to impede their onward march.
This done they all moved on again, the
Mexican, of course, foremost, Kearney at
his heels. After him, Oris Rock, chain in
hand, half leading, half dragging the dwarf, asa
showman might his monkey.

In this way there was no danger of his betraying
them. He could shout and still have
been heard by those behind. But an expressive
gesture of the Texan admonished him that
if he made a noise, it would be the last of him.

A SUSPICION OF CONNIVANCE.

Suspicious, to say the least of it !
If a coincidence, certainly the
strangest in my experience, or
that I've ever heard of. A score of other
carriages passing, and they to have chosen
that one of all ! Carrai ! it cannot have been
chance — improbable — impossible !"

So soliloquised the Chief Magistrate of
Mexico, after receiving a report of what had

occurred in the Calle de Plateros. He had
as yet only been furnished with a general
account of it ; but particularising the prisoners
who had escaped, with their mode of making
off, as also whose carriage they had seized
upon. He had been told, also, that there
were two ladies in it, but needed not telling
who they were.

All this was made known by a messenger
who came post-haste to the Palace, soon after
the occurrence. He had been sent by Colonel
Santander, who could not come himself; too
busy getting the hussars into their saddles
for the pursuit — for he it was who led it.
And never did man follow fugitives with more
eagerness to overtake them, or more bitter
chagrin in their flight.

Not much, if anything, less was that of
Santa Anna himself, as he now sat reflecting
over it. He, too, had seen the two Texans

with Eivas in the sewers ; the latter a well-known
enemy in war, and, as he late believed,
a dangerous rival in love. He had glanced
exultingly at him, with the thought of that
danger past. The rebel proscribed, and for years
sought for, had at length been found; was in his
power, with life forfeit, and the determination
it should be taken. That but a short hour ago,
and now the doomed man was free again !

But surely not ? With a squadron of cavalry
in pursuit, cannon booming, bells ringing,
every military post and picket for miles
round on the alert, surely four men chained
two and two, conspicuous in a grand carriage
could not eventually get off.

It might seem so ; still the thing was possible,
as Santa Anna had reason to know.
A man of many adventures he had himself
more than once eluded a pursuing enemy with
chances little better.

He sat chewing the cud of disappointment,
though not patiently, nor keeping all the
time to his chair. Every now and then he
rose to his feet, made stumping excursions
round the room, repeatedly touched the bell,
to inquire whether any news had been received
of the fugitive party.

The aide-de-camp in attendance could not
help wandering at all this, having had orders
to report instantly whatever word should be
brought in. Besides, why should the great
Generalissimo be troubling himself about so
small a matter as the escape of three or four
prisoners, seeming excited as if he had lost a
battle.

The cause of this excitement the Dictator
alone knew, keeping it to himself. He was
still in the dark as to certain details of
what had transpired, and had sent for the
governor of the Acordada, who should be
able to supply them.

Meantime he went about muttering
threats against this one and that one, giving
way to bitter reflections ; one bitterest of
all, that there had been a suspicion of
connivance at the escape of the prisoners.
But to this there was a sweet side as well ;
so some words uttered by him would indicate:


"Ah, Condesa! You may be clever —
you are. But if I find you've had a hand
in this, and it can be proved to the world,
never was a woman in a man's power more
than you'll be in mine. Title, riches,
family influence, all will be powerless to
shield you. In the cell of a prison where I
may yet have the pleasure of paying you a
visit, you won't be either so proud, or so
scornful, as you've shown yourself in a
palace this same day. Vermes — we shall
see."

Don Pedro Arias."

It was an aide-de-camp announcing the
Governor of the Acordada.

Conduct him in."

Without delay the prison official was
ushered into the presence, looking very sad
and cowed-like. Nor did the reception
accorded him have a restoring influence ;
instead the reverse.

"What's all this, I hear?" thundered
out the disposer of punishments and of
places ; " you've been letting your prisoners
bolt from you in whole batches.
I suppose by this time the Acordada will
be empty."

Excellentissimo ! I am very sorry to
say that four of them "

Yes ; and of the four, two of them you
had orders to guard most strictly —
rigorously."

I admit it, Sire, but-sirrah.

! you needn't waste words excusing
yourself. Your conduct shall be
inquired into by-and-bye. What I want
now is to know the circumstances — the
exact particulars of this strange affair. So
answer the questions I put to you without
concealment or prevarication."

The gaol governor, making humble
obeisance, silently awaited the examination,
as a witness in the box who fears he may
himself soon stand in the dock.

To begin : why did you send those
four prisoners out with the chain-gang ? "

By order of Colonel Santander, Sire.
He said it was your Excellency's wish."

Humph ! Well, that's comprehensible.
And so far you're excusable. But
how came it you didn't see to their being
better guarded ? "

Sire, I placed them in charge of the
chief turnkey — a man named Dominguez —
whom I had found most trustworthy on
other occasions. To-day being exceptional,
on account of the ceremonies, he was
pressed to take drink, and I'm sorry to say
got well-nigh drunk. That will explain
his neglect of duty."

It seems there were two ladies in the
carriage. You know who they were, I
suppose ? "

"By inquiry I have ascertained, your
Excellency. One was the Countess Almonte,
the other Don Luisa Yalverde, as your Excellency
will know, the daughter of him to
whom the equipage belonged. "

Yes, yes. I know all that. I have been
told the carriage made stop directly opposite
to where these men were at work. Was
that so?"

"It was, Sire."

"And have you heard how the stoppage
came about ? "

"Yes, Excellentissimo. The horses shied
at something and brought the wheels into
a bank of mud. Then the cicero, who
appears to be a stupid fellow, pulled them
up, when he ought to have forced them on.
While they were at rest the four forzados
made a rush, two right into the carriage,
the other two up to the box ; one of these
last, the big Tejano, getting hold of the
reins and whip, and driving of at a gallop.
They had only one sentry to pass in the
direction of San Francisco. He, like Dominus,
was too far gone in drink, so there
was nothing to stop them — except the guards
at the veritas. And, I'm sorry to say, the
sergeant at El Nino Permit let them pass
through without so much as challenging.

His account is that, seeing the carriage belonged
to one of your Excellency's Ministers,
he never thought of stopping it, and should
not. Why should he, Sire?"

This touch of obsequious flattery seemed
to mollify the Dictator's wrath, or it had
by this otherwise expended itself, as evinced
by his rejoinder in a more tranquil tone.
Indeed, his manner became almost confidential.


Don Pedro," he said, " I'm satisfied with
the explanation you give, so far as regards
your own conduct in the affair. But now,
tell me ; do you think the ladies w T ho were
in the carriage had anything to do with the
drawing up of the horses ? Or was it allan
accident 1 "

Will your Excellency allow me a moment
to reflect ? I had thought something of
that before : but — "

"Think of it again. Take time and give
me your opinion. Let it be a truthful one,
Don Pedro ; there's much depending on it."

Thus appealed to, the gaol governor stood
for a time silent, evidently cudgelling his
brains. He made mental review of all that
had been told him about the behaviour of the
young ladies, both before they were turned
out of the carriage and after. He was himself
aware of certain relations, friendly at least,
supposed to exist between one of them and
one of the escaped prisoners, and had thought
it strange, too, that particular equipage being
chosen. Still, from all he could gather, after
ample inquiry, he was forced to the conclusion
that the thing was unpremeditated — at least
on the part of the ladies.

This was still his belief, after reflecting ashe
had been enjoined to do. In support of
it he stated the facts as represented to him,

how the Senoritas had been forced from the
carriage, almost pitched into the street, their
costly dresses dirtied and damaged, themselves
showing wildest affright. Still, this w r as
strange, too, on the part of the Condesa ; and
in fine Don Pedro, after further cross-questioning,
was unable to say whether there had been
connivance or not.

After giving such an unsatisfactory account
of the matter he was dismissed, rather
brusquely ; and returned to the Acordada,
with an ugly apprehension that instead of
continuing governor of this grand gaol, with a
handsome salary and snug quarters, he might
ere long be himself the occupant of one of its
cells, set apart for common prisoners.

THE EEPOET OF THE Pursuer.

With unappeased impatience the Dictator
awaited the return of the
pursuing party, or some news of it.
The last he in time received at first hand,
from the lips of its leader, who after nightfall
had hastened back to the city, and reported
himself at the Palace.

You have taken them ? " interrogated

Santa Anna, as the Hussar officer, no longer
2—12

in a glitter of gold lace, but dim with sweat
and dust, was ushered into his presence.

He put the question doubtingly ; indeed
from the expression on Santander's face almost
sure of receiving a negative answer. Negative
it was :

"Not yet, Sire; I regret to say they are
still at large."

The rejoinder was preceded by a string of
exclamatory phrases ill becoming the Chief
of the State, But Santa Anna, being a
soldier, claimed a soldier's privilege of swearing,
and among his familiars, was accustomed
to it as any common trooper. After
venting a strong ebullition of oaths, he calmed
down a little, saying :

Give me a full account of what you've
seen and done."

This was rendered in detail, from the time
of the pursuit being entered upon till it

had ended abortive, by the coming on of
night.

Chancing to be in the Maze, the Colonel
said, when word reached him of what had
occurred in the Calle de Plateros, he made
all haste to pursue with a squadron of
Hussars. Why he took so many was, that
he might be able to send a force along every
road, in case it should be necessary.

He found the escapade had gone out by
El Nino Perdido, the sergeant on guard there
allowing them to go past.

See that he be put under arrest !"

He's under arrest now, your Excellency.
I had that done as I was returning."

Proceed with your relation !"

Which Santander did, telling how he had
followed the fugitive party along the San
Angel Eoad, and there met a troop of Lancers
from Chapultepec. Some field labourers had

seen a carriage turn off towards Coyoacan ;
and taking that route he soon after came
up with it. It was stopped on the roadside ;
empty, horses gone, the harness strewed over
the ground hacked and cut ; the cicero
strapped to one of the wheels, and gagged
with the handle of his whip !

When the man was released he could tell
nothing more than that the four had mounted
his horses, a pair upon each, and galloped off
across the country, on a sort of bridle path,
as if making for the San Antonio Eoad.

Turning in that direction, Santander soon
discovered that they had entered into a tract
of chapparal; and while this was being
searched for them, the unharnessed horses
were observed rushing to and fro in frenzied
gallop, riderless of course. When caught it
was seen why they were now excited, one of
them having its ear slit, the blood still dropping
from the wound.

The chapparal was quartered in every
direction ; but he soon came to the conclusion
it was no use searching for them there.

Carramba ! " interrupted his listener ;
of course not ; I know the place well.
And if you, Senor Colonel, were as well
acquainted with that chapparal, and what
lies alongside it, as one of those you were
after, you'd have dropped the search sooner.
You needn't tell me more ; I can guess the
finish ; they got off into the Peclregal."

"So it would seem, your Excellency."

Seem ! So it is, por certo. And looking
for them there would be so much lost
time. Around your native city, New
Orleans, there are swamps where the runaway
slave manages to hide himself. He'd
have a better chance of concealment here,
among rocks, in that same quarter you've
just come from. It's a very labyrinth. But

what did you afterwards ? You may as well
complete your narrative."

There is not much more to tell, Sire ;
for little more could we do. The darkness
came on, as we discovered they had taken
to the rocks."

You did discover that ? "

Yes, your Excellency. We found the
place where they had gone up over a sort
of cliff. There were scratches made by
their feet, with a branch broken off one of
the cactus plants ; some of the sewer mud,
too, was on the rock. But there was no
path, and I saw it would be useless carrying
the pursuit any further till we should
have the light of morning. I've taken
every precaution, however, to prevent their
getting out of the Pedregal."

What precautions ? "

By completely enfilading it, Sire. I sent

the Lancers round by San Geronimo and
Contreras ; the Hussars to go in the opposite
direction by San Augustin. They have
orders to drop a picket at every path that
leads from it, till they meet on the other
side."

Well, Senor Colonel, your stately is
good. I don't see that you could have done
better under the circumstances. But it's
doubtful whether we shall be able to trap
our foxes in the Pedregal. One of them
knows its paths too well to let night or
darkness hinder his travelling along them.
He'll be through it before your pickets can
get to their stations. Yes ; and off to a
hiding-place he has elsewhere — a safer one —
somewhere in the Sierras. Confound those
Sierras with their caverns and forests.
They're full of my enemies, rebels, and
robbers. But I'll have them rooted out,

hanged, shot, till I clear the country of disaffection.
Carajo ! I shall be master of
Mexico, not only in name, but deeds.
Emperor in reality ! "

Excited by the thought of unrestrained
rule and dreams of vengeance — sweet to the
despot as blood to the tiger — he sprang out
of his chair, and paced to and fro, gesticulating
in a violent manner.

Yes, Senor Colonel ! " he continued intone
satisfied as triumphant. " Other matters
have hindered me from looking after
these skulking prescribes. But our victory
over the Tejanos has given me the power
now, and I intend using it. These men
must be recaptured at all cost — if it take
my whole army to do it. To you, Don
Carlos Santander, I entrust the task — its
whole management. You have my authority
to requisition troops, and spend whatever

money may be needed to ensure success.
And' he added, stepping close to his subordinate,
and speaking in a confidential way,
"if you can bring me back Euperto Bias,
or his head so that I can recognise it, I shall
thank you not as Colonel, but as General
Santander."

The expression upon his face, as he said
this, was truly satanic. Equally so that
on his to whom the horrid hint was given.
Alike cruel in their instincts, with aims
closely corresponding, it would be strange
if the fugitive prisoners were not retaken.

UP THE MOUNTAIN".

E'er going to have a night black
as charcoal' said Eivas, running
his eye along the outline
of the Cordilleras and taking survey of
the sky beyond.

"Will that be against us?" queried the
young Irishman.

In one way, yes ; in another, for us.
Our pursuers will be sure to ride all round the

Prodigal, and leave a picket wherever they
see the resemblance of path or trail leading
out. If it were to come on moonlight — as
luckily it won't — we'd had but a poor
chance to get past them without being seen.
And that would signify a fight against
awkward odds — numbers, arms, everything.
We must steal past somehow, and so the
darkness will be in our favour. "

As may be deduced from this snatch of
dialogue, they were still in the Pedregal.
But the purple twilight was now around
them, soon to deepen into the obscurity of
night ; sooner from their having got nearly
across the lava field, and under the shadow
of Ajusco, which, like a black wall, towered
up against the horizon. They had stooped fora
moment, Eivas himself cautiously creeping
up to an elevated spot, and reconnoitering
the ground in front.

It will be necessary for us to reach the
mountains before morning," he added after a
pause. " Were we but common gaol-birds
who had bolted, it would nt much signify,
and we'd be safe here for days, or indeed
for ever. The authorities of Mexico, such
as they are at present, don't show themselves
very zealous in the pursuit of escaped
criminals. But neither you nor I, Senor
Kearney, come under that category — unluckily
for us just now — and the Pedregal,
labyrinth though it be, will get surrounded
and explored — every inch of it
within the next forty-eight hours. So
out of it we must move this night, or never.' '

Twilight on the table-lands of the western
world is a matter of only a few minutes :
and, while he was still speaking the night
darkness had drawn around them. It
hindered them not from proceeding onwards,

however, the Mexican once more leading off,
after enforcing upon the others to keep close
to him, and make no noise avoidable.

Another half hour of clambering over
rocks, with here and there a scrambling
through thickets of cactus, and he again
came to a stop, all of course doing the same.
This time to use their ears, rather than eyes ;
since around all was black as a pot of
pitch, the nearest object, rock or bush, being
scarcely visible.

For a time they stood listening intently.
Not long, however, before hearing sounds —
the voices of men — and seeing a glimmer
of light, which rose in radiation above the
crest of a low ridge at some distance ahead.

Tin piquet ! " pronounced Eivas in a
half-whisper.

"Toto en la puerto — modo!" (knave
in the door — winner) came a voice in a long

drawn accentuation, from the direction of
the light.

Good !" muttering exclaimed the Mexican,
on hearing it. " They're at their game of
monte. While so engaged not much fear
they'll think of aught else. I know the spot
they're in, and a way that will take us round
it. Come on, cataracts ! The trick's ours !"

Sure enough it proved so. A path that
showed no sign of having ever been trodden,
but still passable, led out past the gambling
soldiers, without near approach to them. And
they were still absorbed in their game — as
could be told by its calls every now and then
drawled out, and sounding strange in that
solitary place — Euperto Kivas conducted his
trio of companions clear of the Pedregal, and
beyond the line of enfiladement.

In twenty minutes after they were mounting
the steep slope of the Cerro Ajusco, amid

tall forest trees with no fear of pursuit by the
soldiers, than if separated from them by a
hundred long leagues.

After breasting the mountain for some time,
they paused to take breath, Eivas saying :

Well, caballeros, we're on safe ground
now, and may rest a bit. It's been a close
shave, though ; and we may thank our stars
there are none in the sky — nor moon. Look
yonder ! They're at it yet. ' Toto en la
puerto — modo f Ha, ha, ha !"

He referred to a faint light visible at a long
distance below, on the edge of the Pedregal,
where they had passed that of a picket fire-camp,
which enabled the monte players to
make out the markings on their cards.

We may laugh who have won," he added,
now seemingly relieved from all apprehension
of pursuit.

Nevertheless the fugitive party stayed buta

short while there ; just long enough to
recover wind. The point they were making
for was still further up the mountain, though
none of them could tell where save Rivas himself.
He knew the place and paths leading toit.
And well ; otherwise he could not have
followed them, so thick was the darkness. In
daylight it would have been difficult enough,
yawning chasms to be crossed arkansas —
with cliffs to be climbed, in comparison with
which the escarpments of the Pedregal were but
as garden walls.

In a groping way, hand helping hand, all
were at length got up and over, as the tolling
of distant church bells, down in the valley
below, proclaimed the hour of midnight. Just
then Rivas, once more making a stop, plucked
a leaf from one of the grass plants growing
by, and placing it between his lips gave out a
peculiar sound, half screech, half whistle. A

signal as the others supposed ; being assured
it was, by the response soon after reaching
their ears.

The signal was given again, with some variations
; responded to in like manner. Then a
further advance up the mountain, and still
another halt ; this time at hearing the hail :

Queiii viva ! "

El Capitan ! " called out Eivas in answer,
and received for rejoinder first an exclamation
of delighted surprise, then words signifying
permission to approach and pass.

The approach was not so easy, being up a
steep incline, almost a cliff. But on reaching
its crest they came in sight of the man who
had challenged, standing on a ledge of rock.
A strange looking figure he seemed to Kearney
and the Texan, wearing a long loose robe,
girded at the waist — the garb of a monk, if
the dim light was not deceiving them. Yet
2—13

with the air of a soldier and sentinel-fashion,
carrying a gun !

He was at " present arms " when they got
up opposite ; and wondering, but without
saying aught, they passed him — their conductor,
after a momentary pause and a
muttered word to him, leading on as before.

Another ascent, this time short, but still
almost precipitous, and this climbing came
to an end.

A FAITHFUL Steward.

HE spot where they had now made
stop — final for the night — was still
far below the summit of the mountain.
It was a sort of platform or bench,
formed by the crest of a projecting spur,
the cliff rising sheer at its back. Its level
surface was only a few acres in extent,
supporting a thick growth of tall evergreen
pines, the long-leaved species indigenous to

Mexico. Centrally there was a place clear
of timber, which ran up to the cliff's base,
or rather to a building contiguous to it. In
front of this they halted, Rivas saying :

Behold my humble abode, caballeros !
Let me bid you welcome to it."

There was light enough to let them see a
massive pile of mason work outlined against
the cliff's facade, while too dim for them
to distinguish its features. They could make
out, however, what appeared to be a pair of
windows with pointed arches, and between
them a large doorway, seeming more like
the mouth of a cavern. Out of this came
a faint scintillation of light ; and as they
drew up to it, a candle could be seen burning
inside a sort of covered porch resembling the
loch-gate of a country church. There were
some stone benches outside, from one of
which a man started up and advanced toward

them, as he did so putting the formal question
: —

Queen es !"

Yo Gregorio ! " was the answer given by
Rivas.

El Capitan ! " exclaimed the questioner,
in a tone also telling of pleased surprise.
And free again ! I'm so glad, Don Rupert !
Praise to the Lord for delivering you ! "

Thanks, good Gregorio ! And while
you're about it you may as well give part of
your praise to a lady, who had something todo
with it — indeed two of them."

Ah ! Senor Capitan ; I think I know one
of them anyhow, and in all Mexico I can say
aye, swear it — "

True, true ! " interrupted the Captain.
But stay your asseveration. There's no time
to talk about the Senoritas now. My friends
and I are in want of something to eat. We're

as hungry as coyotes. What have you got
in the larder ? "

Not much, I fear, your worship. And the
cook's gone to bed, with everybody else. But
they'll only be too delighted to get up when
they hear it's your worship come back. Shall
I go and rouse them, Senor ? "

No, no. Let them sleep it out. Any
cold thing will do for us. We're as much
fatigued as famished, and wish to be in bed
ourselves, as soon as possible. So look out
whatever eatables there are, and don't forget
the wrinkles. I trust the cellar isn't as low
as the larder."

No, Senor. Of that I can speak with
more confidence. Not a cork has been drawn
since you left us — I mean of the best wines.
Only the common Canary was drunk in your
absence."

In that case, mayor-domo, we may sup

satisfactorily, so far as the liquids are concerned,
should the solids prove deficient.
Bring a bottle of Burgundy, another of the
Brown Madeira, and, let me see — yes, one of
old Pedro Ximenes. I suppose the brethren
have used up all my best cigars ? "

Not one of them, Senor. The Savannahs
have been under lock and key, too. I gave
out only pur os"

What a faithful steward you've proved
yourself, Gregorio ! Well, along with the wine,
let us have a bundle of Imperator. We
haven't tasted tobacco for days, and are all
dying for a smoke."

By this time they had entered the porch,
and were passing on through a long corridor,
still more dimly illuminated. But there was
light issuing from a side-door, which stood
open. By this Rivas made stop, with word
and gesture signifying to the others to pass on

inside, which they did. Not all of them, however
; only Kearney and Rock. A different
disposition he meant making of the dwarf than
giving him Burgundy and Madeira to drink,
with the smoking of " Emperor " cigars.
Pointing to the crooked semblance of humanity,
at which Gregorio was gazing with a puzzled
air, he whispered to the latter,

"Take the beast back, and shut him up in
one of the cells. You may give him something
to eat, but see to his being securely
kept. Insignificant as he looks, there's mischief
in him, and he might take it into his
head to stray. You comprehend, Gregorio ?"

"I do, your worship. I'll take care to stow
him safe."

Saying which, the mayor-domo of the
establishment, for such Gregorio was, caught
the hunchback by one of his ears — grand
auricles they were — and led him away along

the corridor, with the prison chain trailing
behind.

Kivas did not stay till they were out of
sight ; but turning, stepped inside the room
into which he had ushered the other two.

It was rather a large apartment, but plainly
and sparsely furnished ; a deal table and
half-a-dozen common chairs, with leathern
backs and bottoms, such as may be seen inmost
Mexican houses. It was better supplied
with arms than household effects ; several
guns standing in corners, with swords hanging
against the walls, and a variety of accoutrements
— all giving it more the appearance of a
guard-house than the reception-room of a
gentleman's mansion.

"Now, amigos," said the Mexican, after
rejoining his guests, on whose faces he could
not fail to note an odd inquiring expression,
I can at last say to you, feel safe, if I can't

assure you of a supper good as I'd wish to
give. Still, if I mistake not, 'twill be superior
to our prison fare. Por Dios! Having to
put up with that was punishment enough of
itself, without being set to work in the
sewers."

"Ah," remarked Kearney, speaking for
himself and the Texan, " Had you been one
of us prisoners, from Mier up to Mexico, the
diet you complain of would have seemed
luxury for Lucullus."

Indeed ! What did they give you to
eat?"

Brown beans only half boiled, tortillas,
usually cold ; and sometimes for a whole
stretch of twenty-four hours nothing at all. "

Carramba ! " exclaimed the Mexican.
That was hard usage. But nothing to surprise.
Just as Santa Anna might be expected
to treat his captive enemies, whether of his

own people, or as yourselves, foreigners.
More cruel tyrant never ruled country. But
his reign, thank Heaven, will not be long.
I've reason for saying that, and better still for
thinking it."

The little interlude of dialogue was brought
to a close by the entrance of the mayor-domo
loaded with bottles and glasses. He had
orders to bring the wine first, the cigars along
with it.

Lumping all down upon the table, he left
them to wait upon themselves, while he went
off to ransack the pantry, soon to return with
a sufficiency of viands, and savoury enough to
satisfy men who had just come out of the
Acordacla. There was cold mutton, ham, and
venison, maize bread, and " guess de Guatemala,"
with a variety of fruit to follow.
Verily a supper at which even a gourmand
might not cavil ; though it was but the debris

of a dinner which seemed to have been partaken
of by a goodly array of guests.

Not long lingered they over it, before whom
it was set a second time. Overcome by the
toil and struggle of days, and more the mental
worry attendant, even the wine freely quaffed
failed to excite them afresh. Best and sleep
they more needed and much desired ; all glad
when Gregorio again showed his face at the
door, saying :

Caballeros, your sleeping rooms are
ready."

ANXIOUS Holes.

ree, Lusita ? Yonder go soldiers ! w
Where ?"

Along the canada of Nino
Perdido — under the trees— by the thick clump
they're galloping !"

Santissima, yes ! I see them now.
Isabel ! if they overtake the carriage ! Ay
Dios /"

Ay Dios, indeed ! It's to be hoped they

won't, though. And I have less fear of it now
than ever. It must have gone that way, or
the soldiers wouldn't be there ; and as it
couldn't have stopped at the garita it should
now be a good distance on. Keep up your
heart, amiga mia, as I do mine. They'll soon
be safe, if they're not yet."

This exclamatory dialogue was carried on
while the alarm bells were still ringing and
the guns booming. The speakers were on
the azote of Don Ignacio's house, up to
which they had hastened soon as home —
having dismissed their escort below, and left
orders for no visitors to be admitted.

In the mirador, with opera-glasses to their
eyes, they had been scanning the roads which
led south and south-west from the city.
Only for a few minutes, as they had but
just got back, and as the carriage having
already rounded the turning to Cayoacan,

they saw but the pursuing soldiers. Those
were the Hussars, with Santander at their
head, though the ladies knew not that.

Fortified by the hopeful speech of the
Condesa, the other responded to it with an
added word of hope, and a prayer for the
safe escape of those they were concerned
about.

Then for a while both remained silent,
with the lorgnettes to their eyes, following
the movements of the soldiers along; the road.
Soon these were out of sight, but their whereabouts
could be told by the cloud of white
dust which rose over the trees, gradually
drifting farther and farther off.

At length it too disappeared, settling down ;
and as the bells ceased to ring and the cannon
to be fired, the city, with all around
it, seemed restored to its wonted tranquillity.
.

But not so the breasts of Luisa Valverde
and Ysabel Almonte. Far from tranquil
they ; instead, filled with anxiety, keen as
ever. And now, as much on their own
account as for those they had been aiding
to escape. In their haste to effect this,
they had taken no thought of what was to
come after. But it was now forced upon
them. As they looked back on what they
had themselves done — the part they had
been playing, with all its details of action —
apprehensions hitherto unfelt began to steal
over them, growing stronger the longer they
dwelt upon them.

For what would be the upshot of all ?

What if the carriage got overtaken with
the fugitives in it, and beside them those
knives and pistols, to say nothing of the
file ? A gentleman's cloak too, with mango
and serape ! Odd assortment of articles for

ladies to take out on an airing ! They had
no fear of the cicero betraying them ; but
this paraphernalia surely would, if it fell into
the hands of the pursuers. They might expect
investigation, anyhow ; but these things,
if produced, would bring about an exposure
unavoidable.

No wonder at their soon becoming seriously
alarmed, henceforth nervously agitated. And
they had no one to take council with. Soon
after their coming home, Don Ignacio, seeing
and hearing of what happened, had sallied
forth to make inquiries, and direct pursuit.
Furious about his fine carriage and horses
carried off, he little dreamt that along with
them were his duelling pistols and blue broadcloth
cloak.

Nor would it do to tell him of those
matters ; unless they made up their minds to
confess all, and fling themselves on his affect


tion, more than his mercy. Of course, he
was still in the dark about their doings —
unsuspicious man — had not even been told
who the forzados were that had taken away
his equipage.

Closeted alone, for some time the alarmed
ladies could not think of what they ought todo.
They did not yield to despair, however ;
instead, kept on scheming and considering how
they might meet the worst — if the worst came.

But one way seemed plausible — even possible
— that depending on Don Ignacio. If
they could prevail on him to tell a falsehood
all might be well. Only to say the carriage
had been made ready for a journey to his
casa de cainpo, whither he had intended to
proceed that same evening, taking his daughter
and the Condesa along with him. That
would explain the presence of the weapons ;
no uncommon thing — rather the rule — for

carriage travellers to take such with them,
even going but outside the suburbs of the
city. For good reason ; there being footpads
and robbers everywhere. And the cloaks for
protection against the night air !

In this way they groped about, as drowning
people clutch at sticks and straws. Still,
without being able to get rid of their apprehensions.
Even should Don Ignacio agree to
the deception they thought of — he would, no
doubt, when made aware of their danger — it
was questionable whether it would serve them.
For there was a file too — a small matter, buta
most conspicuous link in the chain of circumstantial
evidence against them. They in the
carriage would have been using it, before
being taken — if they should be taken.
Finally, the worst of all, the relations known
to exist between themselves and two of the
men attempting escape.

A miserable time it was for them during
the remainder of that afternoon and evening ;
a struggle amid doubts, fears, and conjectures.
Nor did Don Ignacio's return home in anyway
relieve them. They were not yet prepared
to surrender up their secret even to him.
The time had not come for that.

As the hours passed things began to look
better, and the suspense easier to bear. No
report from the pursuers, which there would,
or should, have been Were the pursued overtaken.


Something better still, at length. Jose
back home with the carriage and horses, and
nothing besides — no weapons nor spare wraps !
All gone off, the tell-tale file along with
them.

Pepita brought this intelligence into the
ladies, who longed to have a private interview
with the cicero. But he had first to deliver

his to Don Ignacio, who had sallied out into
the stables to receive it.

A strange tale it was, imparted to an angry
listener, who, while listening, looked upon his
costly harness, patched and mended with
ropes, where it had been cut. His fine prisoner
too, abused, possibly injured for good, the ear
of one of them well nigh severed from the
head ! Slow to wrath though he was, this was
enough to make him wrathful, without the
further knowledge of his other losses, about
which Jose took care not to enlighten him.

At a later hour the circumspect cocker o told
his tale to other ears in terms somewhat different,
and with incidents. His master, summoned
to the palace, gave the opportunity so
much desired by his young mistress and the
Condesa for speaking with him ; and he was
soon in their presence, getting interrogated
with a volubility which made sober reply
almost impossible.

His questioners, however, after a time calming
down, listened to his narration in a detailed
form, though not without repeated
interruptions. He told them about the slow
driving of the carriage along the garden wall
of San Francisco, the putting on the disguises,
and how cleverly they had outwitted the
guard at the garita.

Like Euperto ! " at this juncture exclaimed
the Countess.

Then, of their onward course along the
canada, horses in a gallop, till stopped on the
Coyoacan road, with the action taken there —
quick as it was varied and strange,

Dona Luisa, in her turn, here interrupted
in triumphant exclamation —

"LikeFloreneio!"

In fine, when made known to them how the
fugitives had mounted and ridden off, both
cried out together in terms almost the same —

Thanks to the Virgin, blessed Mother
of God ! We now know they are safe."

Their confidence was strengthened by
further questioning; for the trusted cicero
was able to tell them more. How his horses
had been caught and brought back to him
by two hussars — one of whom he chanced
to have a speaking acquaintance with.
From the soldier he had learnt all about the
pursuit after it had passed beyond him ;
how they had searched the cliapparal, with
fruitless result ; the latest reports being
that the escapade had got into the Pedregal.

That was enough for the Countess, who
springing to her feet and clapping her hands,
cried out :

Joy, Luisita ! They're safe, I'm sure.
Euperto knows the Pedregal, every path
through it, as well as we the walks of the
Alameda. I shall sleep this night better
than the last, and you may do the same."

So assured, Luisa Valvercle, devout as
was her wont, responded with a phrase of
thanksgiving, arms crossed over her bosom,
eyes turned to the picture of Santa Guadalupe
on the wall.

Jose stood waiting, not for any reward.
Recompense for the service he had done
them — so modestly declaring it — was not
in his thoughts at that moment, though it
might be after. But the Conclesa was
thinking of it then. Sure to promise and
contract, she said to him —

Faithful fellow ; — courageous as faithful —
take this : you've fairly earned it."

Whilst speaking she drew the jewelled
watch from her waist, and, passing the chain
over her head, held it out to him.

And this too ! " added the Donna Luisa,
plucking a diamond ring from one of her
fingers, and presenting it at the same time.

No ! " protested the faithful servitor.
Neither the one nor the other. Enough
reward to me to know I've done your ladyship
a service — if I have."

But, good Jose," urged the Countess,
you must either take my watch or the
worth of it in gold dolores ! That was
the understanding, and I shall insist on your
adhering to it."

Muy been, Condesa ; I consent to that.
But only on the condition that the gentleman
get safe off. Till we're sure of that, I beg
your ladyship won't look upon me as a
creditor."

If her ladyship should," here put in a
third personage of the sex feminine, who
had just entered upon the scene, " If she
should, I'll pay the debt myself. I pay it
now — there ! "

It was Pepita who thus delivered herself,

as she did so bounding forward, flinging her
arms around his neck, and giving him a
sonorous kiss upon the cheek ! Then, as she
released her lips after the smack, adding :

I've given you that, hombre, for what ?
Why nothing more than doing your duty.
Ha-ha-ha!"

The laughter neither disconcerted nor vexed
him. It was not scornful ; while the kiss
had been very sweet. Long coveted, but
hitherto withheld, he looked upon it as an
earnest of many others to follow, with a
reward he would more value than all the
watches and rings in Mexico — the possession
of Pepita herself.

A HOLY Brotherhood.

Here the deuce ami?"

It was Florence Kearney who
asked this question, interrogating
himself ; time, the morning after their retreat
up the mountain. He was lying on a low
pallet, or rather bench of mason work, with a
palm mat spread over it, his only coverlet the
cloak he had brought with him from Don
Ignacio's carriage. The room was of smallest
dimensions, some eight or nine feet square,

pierced by a single window, a mere pigeon-hole
without sash or glass.

He was yet only half awake, and, as his
words show, with but a confused sense of his
whereabouts. His brain was in a whirl from
the excitement through which he had been
passing ; so long sustained. Every thing
around seemed weird and dream-like.

Ebbing his eyes to make sure it was a
reality, and raising his head from the hard
pillow, he took stock of what the room contained.
An easy task that. Only a rickety
chair, on which lay a pair of duelling pistols —
one of the pairs found under the carriage
cushions — and his hat hanging on its elbow.
Not a thing more except a bottle, greasy
around the neck, from a tallow candle that had
guttered and burnt out, standing on the uncarpeted
stone floor beside his own boots, just
as he had drawn them off.

"Why he had not noticed these surroundings
on the night before was due to extreme
fatigue and want of sleep. Possibly, the Burgundy,
mixed with the Madeira and Old Pedro
Ximenes, had something to do with it. In any
case he had dropped down upon the mat of
palm, and became oblivious, almost on the
moment of his entering this strange sleeping
chamber, to which the mayor-domo had conducted
him.

Queer crib it is," he continued to soliloquise,
after making survey of the room and
its containing, " for a bed-room. I don't
remember ever having slept in so small a
one, except aboard ship, or in a prison-cell.
How like the last it looks ! "

It did somewhat, though not altogether.
There were points of difference, as a niche
in the wall, with a plaster cast on a plinth,
apparently the image of some saint, with

carvings in the woodwork, crosses, and other
emblems of piety.

It must be an old convent or monastery,"
he thought, after noticing these, " Herein
Mexico they often have them in odd, out-of-the-way
places, I've heard. Out of the
way this place surely is, considering the
climb we've had to reach it. Monks in it
too ? " he added, recalling the two men he
had seen on the preceding night, and how
they were habited. " A strange sort they
seem, with a captain at their head — my
prison companion ! Well, if it give us sanctuary,
as he appears to think it will, I shall
be but too glad to join the holy brotherhood."

He lay a little longer, his eyes running
around the room, to note that the rough
limewash on its walls had not been renewed
for years ; green moss had grown upon them,
and there were seams at the corners, stains

showing where rain-water had run down. If
a monastery, it was evidently not one in
the enjoyment of present prosperity, whatever
it might have been in the past.

While still dreamily conjecturing about it,
the door of his room was gently pushed
ajar, and so held by whoever had opened
it. Turning his head round, Kearney saw
a man in long loose robes, with sandalled
feet and shaven crown, girdle of beads, crucifix,
cowl, and scapular — in short, the garb
of the monk with all its insignia.

I have come to inquire how you have
slept, my son," said the holy man, on seeing
that he was awake. " I hope that the pure
atmosphere of this, our mountain home — so
different from that you've been so lately
breathing — will have proved conducive to
your slumbers."

Indeed, yes," rejoined he inquired after,

conscious of having slept well. " I've had
a good night's rest — the best allowed me
for a long time. But where "

While speaking, he had dropped his feet
to the floor, and raised himself erect on the
side of the bed, thus bringing him face to
face with the friar. What caused him to
leave the interrogatory unfinished was a
recognition. The countenance he saw was a
familiar one, as might be expected after
having been so close to his own — within a
few feet of it — for days past. No disguise
of dress, nor changed tonsure, could hinder
identification of the man who had partaken
of his chain in the Acordada ; for he it
was.

Oh ! Tis you, Don Euperto !" exclaimed
Kearney suddenly changing tone.

"The same, my son," rejoined the other,
with an air of mock gravity.

At which the young Irishman broke out
into a loud guffaw, saying : —

Well, you're the last man I should ever
have supposed to be a monk !"

He recalled some strong denunciations of
the Holy Brethren he had heard pass the lips
of his late fellow prisoner.

"Ah! Senor Don Florencio, in this our
world of Mexico, we are called upon to play
many parts, and make our home in many
places. Yesterday, you knew me as a prisoner,
like yourself in a loathsome gaol ; to-day, you
see me in a monastery. And no common
monk, but an Abbot ; for know, amico mio,
that I am the head of this establishment.
But come ! As your host I am not now
playing the part I should. You must be half
famished ; besides your toilet needs attending
to. For the first, breakfast will be ready by
the time you have looked to the last. Here
2—15

Gregorio !" this was a call to the mayor-domo
outside, who instantly after appeared at the
door. " Conduct this gentleman to the lavatory,
and assist him in making his ablutions."
Then again to Kearney : "If I mistake not,
you will find a clean shirt there, with some
other changes of raiment. And may I ask
you to be expeditious ? It has got to be
rather a late hour for breakfast, and the Holy
Brethren will be getting a little impatient for
it. But, no doubt, your appetite will prompt
you. Hasta Luega ! "

With which salutation — The Mexican custom
at parting for only a short while — he
passed out of the room leaving his guest to be
looked after by Gregorio.

Surrendering himself to the mayor-domo,
Kearney was conducted to an outer room,
in which he found a wash-stand and dressing
table, with towel and other toilet articles —

all, however, of the commonest kind. Even
so, they were luxuries that had been long
denied him — especially the water, a constant
stream of which ran into a stone basin from
some pure mountain spring.

And, sure enough, the clean shirt was therewith
a full suit of clothes ; velveteen jacket,
falconers calzoncillas, scarf of China crape —
in short, the complete costume of a ranchero.
A man of medium size, they fitted him nicely;
and arrayed in them he made a very handsome
appearance.

Now, your honour," said the individual
in charge of him, " allow me to show you the
Refectory."

Another turn along the main passage
brought them to the door, from which issued
a buzz of voices. His host had prepared him
to expect company, and on stepping inside
this door, he saw in the shape of some twenty-five

or thirty men, all in the garb of monks
of the same order as Rivas himself.

The room was a large one, saloon-shape,
with a table standing centrally, around which
were benches and chairs. A cloth was spread
upon it, with a multifarious and somewhat
heterogeneous array of ware — bottles and
glasses being conspicuous. For it was after
eleven o'clock, and the meal almuerzo, as
much dinner as breakfast. The viands were
being put upon it ; three or four Indian
youths, not in convent dress, passing them
through a hatch that communicated with the
kitchen, and from which also came a most
appetising odour.

All this the young Irishman took in with
a sweep of his eye, which instantly after
became fixed upon the friars who had faced
towards him. They were standing in two
or three groups, the largest gathered round

an individual who towered above all of them,
by the head and shoulders. Cris Rock it was,
clean shaven, and looking quite respectable ;
indeed, better dressed than Kearney had seen
him since he left off his New Orleans " store "
clothes. The Colossus was evidently an
object of great interest to his new acquaintances
; and, from the farcical look upon their
faces, it was clear they had been doing their
best to " draw " him. With what success
Kearney could not tell ; though from the
knowledge he had of his old comrade's cleverness
he suspected not much. There was
just time for him to note the jovial air of
the Brethren, so little in keeping with the
supposed gravity of the monastic character,
when the Abbot entering led him up to them,
and gave him a general introduction.

Germans ! " he said, " let me present
another of my comrades in misfortune, the

Sen or Don Florencio Kearney — an Irlandes —
who claims the hospitality of the convent."

They all made bow, some pressing forward,
and extending hands.

But there was no time for dallying over
salutations. By this several dishes had been
passed through the hatch and were steaming
upon the table. So the Abbot took seat at
its head, Kearney beside him ; while the
Texan was bestowed at its foot, alongside one
who seemed to act as vice-chairman.

If the table-cloth was not of the finest
damask, nor the ware costliest china and
cut glass, the repast was worthy of such.
In all the world there is no cuisine superior
to that of Mexico. By reason of certain
aboriginal viands, which figured on the table
of that Aztec sybarite, Montezuma, it beats the
cuisine of old Spain, on which that of France
is founded, and but an insipid imitation.

The monks of this mountain retreat evidently
knew how to live ; course after course
being passed through the hatch in a variety
which seemed as if it would never end.
There were pucheros, guisados, females, and
half a score of other dishes Kearney had
never before heard of, much less tasted. No
wonder at their dinner of the preceding day
having left such debris for supper.

And the wines were in correspondence — in
quality, profusion, everything. To Kearney
it recalled " Bolton Abbey in the olden time ".
Nor ever could the monks of that ancient
establishment on the Wharf have drunk
better wines, or laughed louder while quaffing
them, than they whose hospitality he was receiving
on the side of the Cerro Ajusco.

Some strange speech, however, he heard
passing around him, little in consonance with
what might be supposed to proceed from the

lips of religious men. But, possibly, just such
as came from those of the Winter and Bolton
Brother when around the refectory table.
Not all of it, though. If the talk was worldly,
it savoured little of wickedness — far less than
that of the cowled fraternity of olden times, if
chronicles are to be trusted. And never in
convent hall could have been heard such toast
as that with which the breakfast was brought
to a close, when Eivas rising to his feet, goblet
in hand, the others standing up along with
him, cried out :

P atriay Libertad /"

Country and Liberty ! Strange sentiment in
such a place, and to be received with acclaim
by such people !

Volunteers FOE TEXAS.

'LL go!"

This laconism came from the
lips of a young man who was
walking along the Levee of New Orleans.
Just before giving utterance to it he had made
a sudden stop, facing a dead wall, enlivened,

however, by a larger poster, on which were
printed, in conspicuous letters, the words —

Volunteers for Texas ! "

Underneath, in smaller type, was a proclamation
setting forth the treachery of Santa
Anna and the whole Mexican nation, recalling
in strong terms the massacre of Fanning, the
butchery of Alamo, and other like atrocities ;
ending in an appeal to all patriots and lovers of
freedom to arm, take the field, and fight against
the tyrant of Mexico and his myrmidons.

I'll go !" said the young man, after a
glance given to the printed statement ; then,
more deliberately re-reading them, he repeated
the words with an emphasis that told of his
being in earnest.

The poster also gave intimation of a meeting
to be held the same evening at a certain rendezvous
in Poydras Street.

He who read only lingered to make note of

the address, which was the name of a noted
cafe. Having done this, he was turning to
continue his walk when his path was barred by
a specimen of humanity, who stood full six
foot six in a pair of alligator leather boots, on
the marquette by his side.

So ye're going', air ye ? " was the half
interrogative speech that proceeded from the
individual thus confronting him.

What's that to you ? " bluntly demanded
the young fellow, his temper a little ruffled by
what appeared an impertinent obstruction on
the part of some swaggering bully.

Modern you may think for, young 'unanswered
the booted Colossus, still standing
square in the way ; " modern you may think
for, seen' it's through me that bit o' paper's
been put up on that ere wall."

You're a bill-sticker, I suppose ? " sneeringly
retorted the " young 'un ".

Ha ! ha ! ha ! " laughed the giant, with a
machinations that resembled the neighing of a
horse. " A bill-sticker, eh ! Wal ; I likes
that. An' I likes ynr grit, too, young feller,
for all ye are so massy. But ye needn't git riled,
an' I reckon ye won't, when I tell ye who
I am."

And who are you ; pray ? "

May be ye mount a learn o' Oris
Rock?"

AVhat ! Cris Rock of Texas ? He who at
Fanning's

At Fannia's massacre war shot dead, an'
kim alive again."

Yes," said the interrogator, whose interrogatory
referred to the almost miraculous escape
of one of the betrayed victims of the Goliath
butchery.

Jess so, young feller. An' since ye 'pear to
know something' 'bout me, I needn't tell ye I

ain't no hill-sticker, nor why I 'petrel to slow
impertinence by putting in my jaw when I
lieern ye sing out, ' I'll go'. I short it wouldst
need much intro dux shun to one as I shout soon
hope to call kumarade. Yer coming' to the
rendevvoo the night, ain't ye ? "

Yes ; I intend doing so."

Wal, I'll be there myself ; an' if ye'll only
look high enough, I reckon ye kin sight me
'mong the crowd. 'Ain't like to be the shortest
thar," he added, with a smile that bespoke
pride in his superior stature, " tho' ye'll see
some tall uns too. Anyhow jest look out for
Cris Rock ; and, when found', that chile may be
of some service to ye."

I shall do so," rejoined the other, whose
good humour had become quite restored.

About to bid good-bye, Rock held out a
hand, broad as the blade of a canoe-paddle.
It was freely taken by the stranger, who, while

shaking it, saw that he was being examined
from head to foot.

Look hear ! " pursued the Colossus, as if
struck by some thought which a closer scrutiny
of the young man's person had suggested ;
lev ye ever did any sogerin' ? Yere got
the look omit."

I was educated in a military school — that's
all."

What ? In the States ? "

No. I am from the other side of the
Atlantic."

Oh ! A Britisher. Wal, that don't make
no difference in Texas. Thar's all sorts thar.
English, ain't ye ? "

No," promptly answered the stranger,
with a slight scornful curling of the lip : " I'm
an Irishman, and not one of those who
deny it."

"All the better for that. Thar's a bit of

the same blood somewhat in my own veins,
out o' a grandmother, I believe, as kim over
the mountains into Kaintuck, 'long vi' Dan
Boone an' his lot. So ye're been educated at
a military school then ? D'ye unnerstan'
anything about the training' o' rogers ?

Certainly I do."

Dog-gone, ef you ain't the man we want !
How's ye like to be an officer ? I reckon ye're
best fit for that."

Of course I should like it; but as a stranger
among you I shouldn't stand much chance of
being elected. You choose your officers, don't
you?"

Martin, we select 'em ; an' we're going' toto
hold the elections this very night. Looked
hear, young feller; I like yer looks, an' I've
seed proof ye're got the stuff in ye. Now I
want to tell ye something' ye daughter to know.
I belong to this company that's jest a forming',

and thar's a feller setting' himself up to be its
casting. He's a sort o' half Spanish, half
French Creole, o' Noon Orleans hear, an' we
old Texans don't think much o' him. But
thar's only a few o' us ; while 'mong the Orleans
city fellers' as are going' out to, he's got a big
popularity by standing' no end o' drinks. He
aunt a bad lookin' sort for sogerin' and hez seen
military service, they say. Fer all that thar'
a hang-dog glint 'bout his eyes this child don't
like ; neither do some o' the others. So young
un, if you'll come down to the rendyvoo in
good time an' make a speech — you kin speechify,
can't ye."

Oh, I suppose I could say something."

Wal, you stum J) it, an' I'll put in a word

or two an' then we'll purpose ye for casting ;

an' who knows we mayest git the majority

after all ? You're ^^illin' to try, aunt ye ? "

Quite willing," answered the Irishman,

with an emphasis which showed how much
the proposal was to his mind. " But why,
Mr. Rock, are you not a candidate yourself?
You have seen service, and would make a good
officer, I should say."

Me candidate for officer ! Wal ! I'm big
enough the's true, and ef you like ugly enuf.
But I aunt no ambeeshum the way. Besides
this chile knows nothing' 'bout drill;
an' the's what's wanted bad. Ye see wee aunt
had much regular sogerin' in Texas. Thar's
what the Mexicans lev the advantage o' us an
thar's what you'll lev the same if you'll consent
to Stan'. You say you will ? "

I will if you wish it."

All square then," returned the Texan,
once more taking his protege by the hand, and
giving it a squeeze like the grip of a grizzly
bear. " I'll be on the look-out for ye. Meanwhile
thar's six hours to the good yet afore it

git sundown. So go and purpar yur speech,
while I slide round' among the fellers an' do a
beetle for ye in the line o' canvassing."

After a final bruin-like pressure of the
hand the giant had commenced striding away,
when he again came to a halt, uttering a loud
''Hiloo!"

What is it ?" inquired the young Irishman.


'* It seems that Oris Rock air 'bout one o'
the biofo-est num mor skulls in all Noon Orleans.
Only to think ! I was about starting' to take
the stump for a candidate 'without known' the
first letter o' his name. How wur ye christened,
young feller ? "

Kearney — Florence Kearney."

Florence, ye say ? Aunt that a woman's
name 1 "

True ; but in Ireland many men bear
it?"

Wal, it do seem a little serious ; but it'll
do right slick, an' the Kearney part sons well.
I've learn speak o' Kate Kearney ; thar's a
song 'bout the girl. Most ye be any connexion
o' hern ? "

"No, Mr. Rock, not that I'm aware of. She
was a Killarney woman. I was born a little
further north on the green island."

Wal : no matter what part o' it, yur are
welkin to Texas, I reckon, or the States either.
Kearney — I like the name. It lev a good
ring, an' it'll soon' all the better wi' ' Casting '
for a handle to 't — the which it shall lev afore
ten o'clock this night, if Oris Rock ain't astray
in his reck'nin. But see as ye kum early to
the rendyvoo, so as 't lev time for a talk withe
boys. Thar's a something' in that ; an if
ye're got a ten dollar bill to spare spend it on
drinks all round. Thar's a good deal in that
too."

So saying, the Texan strode ofF, leaving
Florence Kearney to reflect u^Don the counsel
so opportunely extended.

A LADY IN" THE CASE.

HO Florence Kearney was, and what
this motive for becoming a '' filii
the reader shall be told
without much tediousness of detail.

Some six months before the encounter described,
he had landed from a Liverpool cotton
ship on the Levee of New Orleans. A gentleman
by birth and a soldier-scholar by education,
he had o-one to the New World with the design

to complete his boyhood's training by a course
of travel, and prepare himself for the enacting
the "iiietier of a man. That this travel should
be westward, over fresh untrodden fields, instead
of along the hackneyed highways of the
of the European tourist, was partly due to the
counsels of a tutor — who had himself visited
the New World — and partly to his o^vn. natural
inclinations.

In the course of his college studies he had
read the romantic history of Cortez's conquest,
and his mind had become deeply imbued with
the picturesqueness of Mexican scenes ; so that
among the fancies of his youthful life one of
the pleasant est was that of some day visiting
the land of Anahuac, and its ancient capital,
Tenochtitlan. After leaving college the dream
had grown into a determination, and was now
in the act of being realised. In New Orleans
he was so far on his way. He came thither

expecting to obtain passage in a coasting
vessel to some Mexican seaport — Tampico or
Vera Cruz.

Why lie had not at once continued his
journey thither was due to no difficulty in
finding such a vessel. There were schooners
sailing every week to either of the above ports
that would have accommodated him, yet still
he lingered in New Orleans. His reason for
thus delaying was one far from uncommon —
this being a lady ^\T.th whom he had fallen in
love.

At first the detention had been due to a
more sensible cause. Not speaking the Spanish
language, which is also that of Mexico, he knew
that while travelling through the latter country
he would have to go as one dumb. In New
Orleans he might easily obtain a teacher ; and
having sought soon found one, in the person of
Don Ignacio Valverde, — a refugee Mexican

gentleman, a victim of the tyrant Santa Anna,
who, banished from his country, had been for
several years resident in the States as an exile.
And an exile in straitened circumstances, one
of the hardest conditions of life. Once in his
own country a wealthy land osier, Don Ignacio
was now compelled to give lessons in Spanish
to such stray pupils as might chance to present
themselves. Among the rest by chance, came
Florence Kearney, to whom he had commenced
teaching it.

But while the latter was making himself
master of the Andalusian tongue, he also learnt
to love one who spoke it as purely, and far
more sweetly, than Don Ignacio. This was

Don Ignacio's daughter.

********

After parting with Oris Rock, the young
Irishman advanced along the Levee, his head
bowed forward, with eyes to the ground, as if

examining the oyster shells that thickly bestrewed
the path ; anon giving his glance to
the river, as though stirred by its majestic
movement. But he was thinking neither of
the empty bivalves, nor the flow of the mighty
stream. Nor yet of the speech he had promised
to make that same night at the rendezvous of
filibusters. Instead he was reflecting ujDon
that affair of the heart, from which he had
been some time suffering.

To make known his feelings it is necessary to
repeat what passed through his mind after he
had separated from the Texan.

There's something odd in all this," soliloquised
he, as he strode on. " Here am I going
to fight for a country I care nothing about,
and against one with which I have no cause of
quarrel. On the contrary, I have come four
thousand miles to visit the latter, as a peaceful
friendly traveller. Now I propose making

entry into it, sword in hand, as an enemy and
invader ! The native land too of her, who has
taken possession of my heart ! Ah ! therein lies
the very reason : / have not got her's. I fear —
nay, I am certain of that, from what I saw this
morning. Bah ! What's the use of thinking
about it, or about her ? Luisa Valverde cares
no more for me than the half-score of others —
these young Creole ^ bloods,' as they call themselves
— who flit like butterflies around her.
She's a sweet flower from which all of them
wish to sip. Only one will succeed, and that's
Carlos Santander. I hate the very sight of the
man. I believe him to be a cheat and a
scoundrel. No matter to her. The cheat she
won't understand ; and, if report speak true of
her country and race, the scoundrel would
scarcely qualify him either. Merciful heavens !
to think I should love this Mexican girl, warned
as I've been about her country-women ! 'Tis

a fascination and the sooner I get away from it,
and her presence, the better it may be for me.
Now, this Texan business offers a chance of
escaping the peril. If I find she cares not forme,
it will be a sort of satisfaction to think
that in fighting against her country I may ina
way humiliate herself. Ah, Texas ! If you
find in me a defender it wil not be from any
patriotic love of you but to bury bitter thoughts
in oblivion."

The chain of his reflections momentarily
interrupted, was after a time continued : " My
word," he exclaimed, "there's surely something
ominous in my encounter with this Cris Kock !
Destiny seems to direct me. Here am I scheming
to escape from a thraldom of a siren's
smiles, and, to do so, ready to throw myself
into the ranks of a filibustering band ! On the
instant a friend is found — a patron who
promises to make me their leader ! Shall I

refuse the favour, which fortune herself seems
to offer ? Why should I ? It is fate not
chance ; and this night at their meeting I
shall know whether it is meant in earnest.
So, canvas your best for me. Oris Rock ; and I
shall do my best to make a suitable speech.
If our united efforts prove successful, then
Texas shall gain a friend, and Luisa Valverde
lose one of her lovers."

At the conclusion of this speech — half
boastful, half bitter — Florence Kearney had
reached the hotel where he was stopping —
the celebrated " St. Charles," and entering its
grand saloon, sat down to reflect further on
the step he was about to take.

I^^^^HE volunteer rendezvous was in a
l^^pte: tavern, better known by the name
of " Coffee House," in the street
called Poydras. The room which had been
chartered for the occasion was of ample dimensions,
capable of containing three hundred
men. Drawn together by the printed proclamation
that had attracted the attention of the
young Irishman in his afternoon stroll, two-thirds

of the above number had collected
together, and of these at least one-half were
determined upon proceeding to Texas.

It was a crowd composed of heterogeneous
elements — such as has ever been, and ever
will be, the men who volunteer for a military,
more especially a filibustering, expedition.

Present in the hall were representatives of
almost every civilised nation upon earth.
Even some that could scarce boast of civilisation
; for among the faces seen around the
room were many so covered with beards, and
so browned with sun, as to tell of long sojourn
in savage parts, if not association with the
savages themselves.

In obedience to the counsels of the Texan,
Florence Kearney — a candidate for command
over this motley crew — made early appearance
in their midst. Not so early as to find that,
on entering the room, he was a stranger to its

occupants. Oris Rock had been there before
him, along with a half-score of his confreres —
old Texans of the pure breed — who having
taken part in most of the struggles of the
young Eepublic, had strayed back to New
Orleans, partly for a spree, and partly to
recruit fresh comrades to aid them in propagating
that principle which had first taken
them to Texas — the " Monroe Doctrine".

To these the young Irishman was at once
confidentially introduced, and " stood drinks "
freely. He would have done so without care
of what was to come of it ; since it was but
the habit of his generous nation. Nor would
this of itself have given him any great advantage,
for not long after entering the room, he
discovered that not only drinks, but dollars,
were distributed freely by the opposition
party, who seemed earnestly bent upon making
a captain of their candidate.

As yet Kearney had not looked upon his
competitor, and was even ignorant of his
name. Soon, however, it was communicated
to him, just as the man himself, escorted by a
number of friends, made his appearance in the
room. The surprise of the young Irishman
may be imagined, when he saw before him one
already known, and too well known, his rival
in the affections of Luisa Valverde !

Yes ; Carlos Santander was also a candidate
for the command of the filibusters.

To Kearney the thing was a surprise, and
something besides. He knew Santander to be
on terms of very friendly and intimate relationship
not only with Don Ignacio, but other
Mexicans he had met at the exile's house.
Strange, that the Creole should be aspiring to
the leadership of a band about to invade their
country ! For it was invasion the Texans now
talked of, in retaliation for a late raid of the

Mexicans to their capital, San Antonio. But
these banished Mexicans being enemies of
Santa Anna, it was after all not so unnatural.
By humiliating the Dictator, they would be
aiding their o^tl party to get back into power
even though the help came from their hereditary
foemen, the squatters of Texas.

All this passed through the mind of the
young Irishman, though not altogether to
satisfy him. The presence of Santander there
as aspirant for leadership seemed strange notwithstanding.


But he had no opportunity for indulging in
conjectures — only time to exchange frowns at
his rival and competitor, when a man in undress
uniform — a Texan colonel — who acted as
chairman of the meeting, mounting upon a
table, cried " Silence ! " and, after a short
pithy speech, proposed that the election of
officers should at once proceed. The proposal

was seconded, no one objecting ; and, without
further parley, the " balloting " began.

There was neither noise nor confusion. Indeed,
the assembly was one of the quietest,
and without any street crowd outside. There
were reasons for observing a certain secrecy in
the proceedings ; for, although the movement
was highly popular all over the States, there
were some compromising points of International
law, and there had been talk of Government
interference.

The election was conducted in the most
primitive and simple fashion. The names of
the candidates were written upon slips of
paper, and distributed throughout the room —
only the members who had formed the organisation
having the right to vote. Each of
them chose the slip bearing the name of
him he intended to vote for, and dropped
it into a hat carried round for the purpose.

The other he threw away, or slipped into his
pocket.

When all had deposited their ballots, the
hat was capsized, and the bits of paper shaken
out upon the table. The chairman, assisted by
two other men, examined the votes and
counted them. Then ensued a short interval
of silence, broken only by an occasional word
of direction from the chairman, with the murmuring
hum of the examiners, and at length
came in a clear loud voice — that of the Texan
colonel — " The votes are in favour of Kearney !
Florence Kearney elected Captain by a majority
of thirty-three ".

A cheer greeted the announcement, in which
something like a screech from Cris Rock could
be heard above all voices ; while the giant himself
was seen rushing through the crowd to clasp
the hand of his protege, whom, he had voluntarily
assisted in promoting to a rank above himself.

During the excitement, the defeated candidate
was observed to skulk out of the room.
Those who saw him go couki tell by his look
of sullen disappointment he had no intention
of returning ; and that the filibustering cohort
was not likely to have the name, '' Carlos
Santander," any longer on its roll-call.

He and his were soon forgotten. The lieutenants
were yet to be chosen. One after
another — first, second, and brevet — was proposed,
balloted for, and elected in the same
way as the captain.

Then there was a choice of sergeants and
corporals, till the organisation was pronounced
complete. In fine, fell a shower of congratulations,
with " drinks all round," and for
several successive rounds. Patriotic speeches
also, in the true " spread-eagle " style, with
applauding cheers, and jokes about Santa
Anna and his core-leg ; when the company at

length separated, after singing the " Star-spangled
Banner ".

[Florence Kearney, parting from
his new friends, the filibusters, sauntered
forth upon the street.
On reaching the nearest corner he came to a
stop, as if undecided which way to turn.

Not because he had lost his way. His hotel
was but three blocks off ; and he had, during
his short sojourn in the Present City, become
acquainted with almost every part of it. It

was not ignorance of the locality, therefore,
which was causing him to hesitate ; but something
very different, as the train of his thoughts
will tell.

"Don Ignacio, at least, will expect me —
wish me to come, whether she do or not. I
accepted his invitation, and cannot well — oh !
had I known what I do now — seen what I saw

this morning . Bah ! I shall return to

the hotel and never more go near her ! "

But he did not return to his hotel ; instead,
still stood irresolute, as if the thing were worth
further considering.

What made the young man act thus?
Simply a belief that Luisa Valverde did not
love him : and, therefore, would not care to
have him as a companion at supper ; for it was
to supper her father had asked him. On the
day before he had received the invitation, and
signified acceptance of it. But he had seen

something since which had made him half
repent having done so; a man, Carlos Santander,
standing beside the woman he loved, bending
over her till his lips almost touched her forehead,
whispering words that were heard and to
all appearance heeded. What the words were
Florence Kearney knew not, but could easily
guess their nature. They could only be of
love ; for he saw the carmine on her cheeks as
she listened to them.

He had no right to call the young lady to
an account. During all his intercourse with
Don Ignacio, he had seen the daughter scarce
half-a-score times ; then only while passing out
and in — to or from his lessons. Now and then
a few snatches of conversation had occurred
between them upon any chance theme — the
weather — the study he was prosecuting (how
he wished she had been his teacher) — and
the peculiarities of the New Orleans life, to

which they were both strangers. And only
once had she appeared to take more than an
ordinary interest in his speech. This, when
he talked of Mexico, and having come from his
own far land — " Irlandesa " — with an enthusiastic
desire to visit hers, telling her of his
intention to do so. On this occasion he had
ventured to speak of what he had heard about
Mexican banditti; still more of the beauty of the
Mexican ladies — naively adding that he would
no doubt be in less cano-er of losing; his life
than his heart.

To this he thought she had listened, or
seemed to listen with more than ordinary attention,
looking pensive as she made reply.

Yes, Don Florencio ! you will see much in
in Mexico likely to give you gratification.
'Tis true indeed that many of my countrywomen
are fair — some very fair. Among them
you will soon forget "

Kearney's heart beat wildly, lisping lie
would hear the monosyllable "me". But the
word was not spoken. In its place the phrase
*sus poor exiles," with which somewhat
commonplace remark the young Mexican
concluded her speech.

And still there was something in what she
had said, but more in her manner of saying it,
which made pleasant impression upon him —
something in her tone that touched a chord
already making music in his heart. If it did
not give him surety of her love, it, for the
time, hindered him from despairing of it.

All this had occurred at an interview he had
with her only the day before ; and, since,
sweet thoughts and hopes were his. But on
the same morning they were shattered — crushed
out by the spectacle he had witnessed, and the
interpretation of those whispered words he had
failed to hear. It had chased all hope out of

his heart, and sent him in wild aimless strides
along the street, just in the right frame of mind
for being caught by that call which had attracted
his eyes on the poster —

"Volunteers FOR TEXAS."

And just so had he been caught; and, as described,
entered among the filibustering band to
be chosen its chief.

To the young Irishman it was a day of
strange experiences, varying as the changes
of a kaleidoscope ; more like a dream than
reality; and after reflecting upon it all, he thus
interrogated himself —

Shall I see her again, or not ? Why not ?
If she's lost, she cannot be worse lost by my
having another interview with her. Nor could
I feel worse than I do now. Ah ! with this
laurel fresh placed upon my brow ! What if
I tell her of it — tell her I am about to enter
her native land as an invader? If she care

for her country that should spite her ; and if I
find she cares not for me, her spite would give
give me pleasure."

It was not an amiable mood for a lover contemplating
a visit to his sweetheart. Still,
natural enough under the circumstances ; and
Florence Kearney, wavering no longer, turned
his steps towards that part of the city where
dwelt Don Ignacio Valverde.

A STUDIED INSULT.

N a small house of the Third Municipality,
in the street called Casa
Calvo, dwelt Don Ignacio Valverde.
It was a wooden structure — a frame dwelling
of French-Creole fashion, consisting of but a
single story, with casement windows that
opened on a verandah, in the Southern States
termed piazza; this being but little elevated
above the level of the outside street. Besides

Don Ignacio and his daughter but one other
individual occupied the house — their one only
servant, a young girl of Mexican nativity and
mixed blood, half white half Indian — in short,
a messina. The straitened circumstances of
the exile forbade a more expensive establishment.
Still the insignia within were not those
of pinched poverty. The sitting-room, if small
was tastefully furnished, while among other
chattels, speaking of refinement, were several
volumes of books, a harp and a guitar, with
accompaniment of sheets of music. The strings
of these instruments Luisa Valverde knew how
to touch with the skill of a professional, both
being common in her own country.

On that night, when the election of the filibustering
officers was being held in Poydras-
street, her father, alone with her in the same
sitting-room, asked her to play the harp to the
accompaniment of a song. Seating herself to

the instrument lie obeyed, singing one of those
romances in which the language of Cervantes
is so rich. It was, in fact, the old song " El
Bravado," from which has been filched the music
set to Mrs. Norton's beautiful lay, "Love not".
But on this night the spirit of the Mexican
senorita was not with her song. Soon as it
was finished, and her father had become otherwise
engaged, she stepped out of the room, and,
standing in the piazza, glanced through the
trellised lattice-work that screened it from the
street. She evidently expected some one to
come that way. And as her father had invited
Florence Kearney to supper, and she knew of
it, it would look as if he were the expected one.
If so, she was disappointed for a time, though
a visitor made his appearance. The door bell,
pulled from the outside, soon after summoned
Pepita, the Mexican servant, to the front, and
presently a heavy footfall on the wooden steps

of the porch, told of a man stepping upon the
piazza.

Meanwhile, the young lady had returned
within the room ; but the night being warm,
the hinged casement stood ajar, and she could
see through it the man thus entering. An
air of disappointment, almost chagrin, came
over her countenance, as the moonlight disclosed
to her view the dark visage of Carlos
Santander.

'' Pass V. adientro, Senor Don Carlos''
said her father also recognising their visitor
through the casement ; and in a moment after
the Creole stepped into the room, Pepita
placing a chair for him.

Though," continued Don Ignacio, " we did
not expect to have the honour of your company
this evening, you are always welcome."

Notwithstanding this polite speech, there was
a certain constraint or hesitancy in the way

it was spoken that told of some insincerity.
It was evident that on that night at least Don
Carlos' host looked upon him in the light of an
intruder. Evidence of the same was still more
marked on the countenance, as in the behaviour
of Don Ignacio's daughter. Instead of a smile
to greet the new comer, something like a frown
sat upon her beautiful brow, while every now
and then a half angry flash from her large
liquid eyes, directed towards him, might have
told him he was aught but welcome. Clearly
it was not for him she had several times during
the same night passed out into the piazza
and looked through its lattice work.

In truth, both father and daughter seemed
disturbed by Santander's presence, both expecting
one whom, for different reasons, they did
not desire him to meet. If the Creole noticed
their repugnance he betrayed no sign of it.
Don Carlos Santander, besides being physically

handsome, was a man of rare intellectual
strength, with many accomplishments, among
others the power of concealing his thoughts
under a mask of imperturbable coolness. Still
on this night his demeanour was different from
its wont. He looked flurried and excited, his
eyes scintillating as with anger at some affront
lately offered him, and the sting of which still
rankled in his bosom. Don Ignacio noticed
this, but said nothing. Indeed he seemed to
stand in awe of his guest, as though under some
mysterious influence. So was he, and here it
may as well be told. Santander, though by
birth an American and a native of New Orleans,
was of Mexican parentage, and still regarded
himself as a citizen of the country of his ancestors.
Only to his very intimates was it known
that he held a high place in the confidence of
Mexico's Dictator. But Don Ignacio knew this,
and rested certain hopes upon it. More than

once had Santander, for motives that will presently
appear, hinted to him the possibility of
a return to his own land, with restoration of
the estates he had forfeited. And the exiled
patriot, wearied with long waiting, was at
length willing to lend an ear to conditions,
which, in other days, he might have spurned
as humiliating if not actually dishonourable.

It was to talk of these Santander had now
presented himself; and his host suspecting it,
gave the young lady a side look as much as to
say, " Leave the room, Luisita ".

She was but too glad to obey. Just then
she preferred a turn upon the piazza ; and into
this she silently glided, leaving her father
alone nth the guest who had so inopportunely
intruded.

It is not necessary to repeat what passed
between the two men. Their business was to
bring to a conclusion a compact they had already

talked of, though only in general terms. It
had reference to the restitution of Don Ignacio's
confiscated estates, with, of course, also the
ban of exile being removed from him. The
price of all this, the hand of his daughter given
to Carlos Santander. It was the Creole who
proposed these terms, and insisted upon them,
even to the humiliation of himself. Madly in
love with Luisa Valverde, he suspected that on
her side there was no reciprocity of the
passion. But he would have her hand if he
could not her heart.

On that night the bargain was not destined
to reach a conclusion, their conference being
interrupted by the tread of booted feet, just
ascending the front steps, and crossing the
floor of the piazza. This followed by an exchange
of salutations, in which the voice of
Luisa Valverde was heard mingling with that
of a man.

Don Ignacio looked more troubled than
surprised. He knew who was there. But
when the words spoken outside reached the
ears of Carlos Santander, first, in openly exchanged
salutations and then whispers seemingly
secret and confidential, he could no
longer keep his seat, but springing up, exclaimed
—

Carrai! It's that dog of an Irides!"

"His!" continued his host. "The Senor
Florencio will hear you."

I wish him to hear me. I repeat the
expression, and plainly in his own native
tongue. I call him a cur of an Irishman."

Outside was heard a short, sharp ejaculation,
as of a man startled by some sudden surprise.
It was followed by an appealing speech, this
in the softer accents of a woman. Then the
casement was drawn abruptly open showing
two faces outside. One that of Florence

Kearney set in an angry frown; the other
Luisa Valvercle's pale and appealing. An
appeal idle and too late as she herself saw.
The air had become charged with the electricity
of deadliest anger, and between the two
men a collision was inevitable.

Without waiting for a word of invitation,
Kearney stepped over the casement sill, and
presented himself inside the room. Don
Ignacio and the Creole were by this also on
their feet; and for a second or so the three
formed a strange triangular tableau — the
Mexican with fear on his face, that of Santander
still wearing the expression of insult,
as when he had exclaimed, " Cur of an Irishman!"
Kearney confronting him with a look
of indignant defiance.

There was an interval of silence, as that of
calm preceding storm. It was broken by the
guest latest arrived saying a few words to his

host, but in calm, dignified tone; an apology
for having unceremoniously entered the
room.

No need to apologise," promptly rejoined
Don Ignacio. " You are here by my invitation,
Senor Don Florencio, and my humble
home is honoured by your presence."

The Hidalgo blood pure in Valverde's veins,
had boiled up at seeing a man insulted under
his roof.

Thanks," said the young Irishman.

'rand now, sir," he continued, turning to
Santander and regarding him with a look of
recovered coolness, '' having made my apology,
I require yours ".

For what ? '* asked Santander, counterfeiting
ignorance.

For using language that belongs to the
bagnios of New Orleans, where, I doubt not,
you spend most part of your time."

Then, suddenly changing tone and expression
of face, he added —

Cur of a Creole ! you must take back your
words ? "

Never ! It's not my habit to take, but to
give ; and to you I give this ! "

So saying, he stepped straight up to the
Irishman, and spat in his face.

Kearney's heart was on fire. His hand was
already on the butt of his pistol ; but, glancing
behind, he saw that pale appealing face,
and with an effort restrained himself, calmly
saying to Santander :

Calling yourself a gentleman, you will no
doubt have a card and address. May I ask
you to favour me with it, as tomorrow I shall
have occasion to write to you ? If a scoundrel
such as you can boast of having a friend, you
may as well give him notice he will be needed.
Your card, sir!"

"Take it!" hissed the Creole, flinging his
card on the table. Then glaring around, as if
his glance would annihilate all, he clutched
hold of his hat, bowed haughtily to Don
Ignacio, looked daggers at his daughter, and
strode out into the street.

Though to all appearance defeated and
humbled, he had in truth succeeded in his
design, one he had long planned and cherished
to bring about, a duel with Kearney in which
his antagonist should be challenger. This
would give him the choice of weapons, which,
as he well knew, would ensure to him both
safety and success. Without the certainty of
this, Carlos Santander would have been the
last man to provoke such an encounter ; for,
with all his air of bravache, he was the veriest
of cowards.

TO THE SALUTE!

HE thick "swamp-fog" still hovered
above the Crescent City, when a
carriage drawn by two horses rolled
out through one of its suburbs, and on along
the Shellroad, and in the direction of Lake
Pontchartrain.

It was a close carriage — a hackney — with
two men upon the driver's seat and three
inside. Of these last, one was Captain Florence

Kearney and another Lieutenant Francis
Crittenden, both officers of the filibustering
band, with titles not two days old. Now on
the way neither to Texas nor Mexico, but to the
shore of Lake Pontchartrain, where many an
affair of honour has been settled by the spilling
of much blood. A stranger in New Orleans,
and knowing scarce a soul, Kearney had bethought
him of the young fellow who had
been elected first lieutenant, and asked him to
act as his second. Crittenden, a Kentuckian,
being one of those who could not only stand
fire, but eat it, if the occasion called, eagerly
responded to the appeal ; and they were now
en route along the Shell road to meet Carlos
Santander and whoever he might have with
him.

The third individual inside the carriage
belonged to that profession, and one of whose
members usually makes the third in a duel —

""''^m

the doctor. He was a young man who, in the
capacity of surgeon, had attached himself to
the band of filibusters.

Besides the mahogany box balanced upon
his thigh, there was another lying on the
spare bit of cushion beside him, opposite to
where Crittenden sat. It was of a somewhat
different shape ; and no one who had ever seen
a case of duelling pistols could mistake it for
aught else — for it was such.

As it had been arranged that swords were to
be the weapons, and a pair of these were seen
in a corner of the carriage, what could they be
wanting with pistols ?

It was Kearney who put this question ; now
for the first time noticing what seemed to him
a superfluous armament. It was asked of
Crittenden to whom the pistols belonged ; as
might have been learnt by looking at his name
engraved on the indented silver plate.

"Well," answered the Kentucldan ; "I'm
no great swordsman myself. I usually prefer
pistols, and thought it may be as well to bring
a pair along. I didn't much like the look of
your antagonist's friend, and it's got into my
head that before leaving the ground I may
have something to say to him on my own
account. So if it come to that I shall take to
the barkers."

Kearney smiled, but said nothing, feeling
satisfied that in case of any treachery, he had
the right sort of man for his second.

He might have felt further secure, in a still
other supporting party, who rode on the box
beside the driver. This was a man carrying a
a long rifle, that stood with the barrel two
feet above his shoulders, and the butt rested
between his heavily booted feet.

It was Oris Rock who had insisted on coming
along as he said, to see that the fight was

all " fair and square ". He too had conceived
an unfavourable opinion of both the men to be
met, from what he had seen of them at the
rendezvous ; for Santander's second had also
been there. With the usual caution of one
accustomed to fighting Indians, he always
went armed, and usually with his long "pea "
rifle.

On reaching a spot of open ground alongside
the road and near the shore of the lake,
the carriage stopped. It was the place of the
appointed meeting as arranged by the seconds
on the preceding day.

Though their antagonists had not yet arrived,
Kearney and Crittenden got out, leaving the
young surgeon busied with his cutlery and
bandage apparatus.

"I hope you won't have to use them,
doctor," remarked Kearney, with a light laugh,
as he sprang out of the carriage. "I don't

want you to practice upon me till we've made
conquest of Mexico."

And not then, I trust," soberly responded
the surgeon.

Crittenden followed, carrying the swords ;
and the two leaping across the drain which
separated the road from the duelling ground,
took stand under a tree.

Kock remained firm on the coach box still
seated and silent. As the field was full under
his view, and within range of his rifle, he knew
that, like the doctor, he would be near enough
if wanted.

Ten minutes passed — most of the time in
solemn silence, on the part of the principal,
with some anxious thoughts. No matter how
courageous a man may be — however skilled in
weapons, or accustomed to the deadly use of
them — he cannot, at such a crisis, help having
a certain tremor of the heart, if not a misgiving

of conscience. He has come there to kill, orbe
killed ; and the thought of either should be
sufficient to disturb mental equanimity. At
such times he who is not gifted with natural
courage had needs have a good cause, and confidence
in the weapon to be used. Florence
Kearney possessed all three ; and though it
was his first appearance in a duel, he had no
fear for the result. Even the still sombre
scene, with the long gray moss, hanging down
from the dark cypress trees like the drapery of
a hearse, failed to inspire him with dread. If
at times a slight nervousness came over him it
was instantly driven off by the thought of the
insult he had received — and perhaps, also, a
little by the remembrance of those dark eyes
he fancied would flash proudly if he triumphed,
and weep bitterly were he to suffer discomfiture.
Very different were his feelings now from those
he experienced less than forty-eight hours before.

when lie was on his way to the house of Don
Ignacio Valverde. That night before leaving
it, he was good as sure he possessed the heart
of Don Ignacio's daughter. Indeed she had all
but told him so ; and was this not enough to
nerve him for the encounter near at hand ?

Very near now — close to commencing. The
rumbling of wheels heard through the drooping
festooned of the trees, proclaimed that a second
carriage was approaching along the Shell road.
It could only be that containing the antagonists.
And it was that. In less than ten minutes
after it drew up on the causeway about twenty
paces to the rear of the one abbacy arrived.
Two men got out, who although wrapped in
cloaks and looking as large as giants through
the thick mist could be recognised as Carlos
Santander and his second. There was a third
individual, who, like the young surgeon, remained
by the carriage — no doubt a doctor,

too, — making the duelling party symmetrical
and complete.

Santander and his friend having pulled off
their cloaks and tossed them back into the
carriage, turned towards the wet ditch, and
also leaped over it.

The first performed the feat somewhat awkwardly,
drooping down upon the further bank
with a ponderous thud. He was a large,
hardly built man — altogether unlike one possessing
the activity necessary for a good swordsman.


His antagonist might have augured well from
his apparent clumsiness, but for what he had
heard of him. For Carlos Santander, though
having the repute of a swaggerer, with some
suspicion of cowardice, had proved himself a
dangerous adversary by twice killing his man.
His second — a French Creole, called Duperon —
enjoyed a similar reputation, he, too, having

been several times engaged in affairs that resulted
fatally. At this period New Orleans
was emphatically the city of the duello — for
this speciality perhaps the most noted in the
world.

As abbacy said, Florence Kearney knew the
sort of man he had to meet, and this being his
own first appearance in a duelling field, he
might well have been excused for feeling some
anxiety as to the result. It was so slight, however,
as not to betray itself, either in his looks
or gestures. Confiding in his skill, gained by
many a set-to nth buttoned foils, and supported
as he was by the gallant young Kentuckian,
he knew nothing that could be called
fear. Instead as his antagonist advanced towards
the spot where he was standing, and he looked
at the handsome, yet sinister face — his thoughts
at the same time reverting to Luisa Valverde,
and the insult upon him in her presence — his

nerves, not at all unsteady, now became firm
as steel. Indeed the self-confident, almost
jaunty air, with which his adversary came upon
the ground, so far from shaking them — the
effect no doubt intended — but braced them the
more.

When the new comers had advanced a certain
distance into the meadow, Crittenden forsaking
his stand under the tree, stepped out to
meet them, Kearney following a few paces behind.


A sort of quadruple bow was the exchanged
salutation ; then the principals remained apart,
the seconds drawing nigher to one another and
entering upon the required conference.

Only a few words passed between them, as
but few were required ; the weapons, distance,
and mode of giving the word, having all been
pre-arranged.

There was no talk of apology — nor thought

of it being either offered or accepted. By
their attitude, and in their looks, both the
challenged and challenger showed a full, firm
determination to fight. Duperon did not seem
to care much one way or the other, and the
Kentuckian was not the sort to seek conciliation
with an insult such as his captain had received
calling for chastisement.

After the preliminaries were passed over,
the seconds again separated — each to attend
upon his principal.

The young Irishman took off his coat, and
rolled back his shirt sleeves up to the elbow.
Santander, on the other hand, who wore a red
flannel shirt under his ample sacque, simply
threw aside the latter, leaving the shirt sleeves
as they were buttoned around the wrist.

Every body was now silent ; the hackney
drivers on their boxes, the doctors, the gigantic
Texan, all looming large and spectral-like

through the still lingering mist, while the
streamers of Spanish moss hanging from the
cypresses atomic were appropriate drapery for
such a scene.

In the midst of the deathlike silence a voice
broke in coming from the top of a tall cypress
standing near. Strange and wild, it was
enough not only to startle, but awe the stoutest
heart. A shrill continued machinations which,
though human-like could scarce be ascribed to
aught human, save the laughter of a maniac.

It frightened no one there, all knowing what
it was — the cackling cry of the white-headed
eagle.

As it ended, but before its echoes had ceased
reverberating among the trees, another sound,
equally awe-inspiring, woke the echoes of the
forest further down. This the ivhoo-ivhoo-
ivJiooa of the great southern owl, seemingly a
o-roan in answer to the easfle's lauo^h.

In all countries, and throughout all ages,
the hooting of the owl has been superstitiously
dreaded as ominous of death, and might have
dismayed our duellists, had they been men of
the common kind of courage. Neither were
or seemed not to be ; for as the lugubrious
notes were still echoing in their ears, they
advanced, and with rapiers upraised, stood
confronting each other, but one look on their
faces, and one thought in their hearts — ''to
hill''

A DUEL "TO THE DEATH".

HE duellists stood confronting one
another, in the position of " salute,"
both hands on high grasping their
swords at hilt and point, the blades held
horizontally. The second of each was in his
place, on the left hand of his principal, half
a pace in advance. But a moment more all
were waiting for the word. The second of the
challenger had the right to give it, and Crit-tender
was not the man to make delay.

Engage ! " lie cried out, in a firm clear
voice, at the same time stepping half a pace
forward, Duperon doing the same. The movement
was made as a precaution against foul
play ; sometimes, though not always, intended.
For in the excitement of such a moment, or
under the impatience of angry passion, one or
other of the principals may close too quickly
to prevent which is the duty of the seconds.

Quick, at the ^' engage," both came to
"guard" with a collision that struck sparks
from the steel, proving the hot anger of the
adversaries. Had they been cooler, they
would have crossed swords quietly. But when,
the instant after, they came to tierce, both
appeared more collected, their blades for a
while keeping in contact, and gliding around
each other as if they had been a single piece.

For several minutes this cautious play continued,
without further sparks, or only such as

appeared to scintillate from the eyes of the
combatants. Then came a counterthrust,
quickly followed by a counter parry, with no
advantage to either.

Long ere this, an observer acquainted with
the weapons they were wielding, could have
seen that of the two Kearney was the better
swordsman. In changing from carte to tierce,
or reversely, the young Irishman showed himself
possessed of the power to keep his arm
straight and do the work with his wrist, whilst
the Creole kept bending his elbow, thus exposing
his forearm to the adversary's point.

It is a rare accomplishment among swordsmen,
but when present, insuring almost certain
victory, that is, other circumstances being
equal.

In Kearney's case, it perhaps proved the
saving of his life ; since it seemed to be the
sole object of his antagonist to thrust in upon

him, heedless of his owt guard. But the
long, straight point, from shoulder far outstretched,
and never for an instant obliquely,
foiled all his attempts.

After a few thrusts, Santander seemed surprised
at his fruitless efforts. Then over his
face came a look more like fear. It was the
first time in his duelling experience he had
been so baffled, for it was his first encounter
sith an adversary who could keep a straight
arm.

But Florence Kearney had been taught
tierce as well as carte, and knew how to
practice it. For a time he was prevented from
trying it by the other's impetuous and incessant
thrusting, which kept him continuously
at guard, but as the sword-play proceeded, he
began to discover the weak points of his
antagonist, and, with a well-directed thrust, at
length sent his blade through the Creole's outstretched

arm, impaling it from wrist to
elbow.

An ill-suppressed cry of triumph escaped
from the Kentuckian's lips, while with eyes
directed towards the other second, he seemed
to ask :

Are you satisfied ?"

Then the question was formally put.

Duperon looked in the face of his principal,
though without much show of interrogating
him. It seemed as if he already divined what
the answer would be.

''A la mort'' cried the Creole, with a
deadly emphasis and bitter determination in
his dark sinister eyes.

'' To the death be it ! " was the response of
the Irishman, not so calmly, and now for the
first time showing anger. Nor strange he
should, since he now knew he had crossed
swords with a man determined on taking his life.

There was a second or two's pause, of which
Santander availed himself, hastily whipping a
handkerchief round his wounded arm — a permission
not strictly according to the code, but
tacitly granted by his gallant antagonist.

When the two again closed and came to
guard, the seconds were no longer by their
sides. At the words "a la mort" they had
withdrawn — each to the rear of his principal
the mode of action in a duel to the death.
Their role henceforth was simply to look on,
with no right of interference, unless either of
the principals should attempt foul play. This,
however, could not well occur. By the phrase
*'a la mort'' it conveyed a peculiar meaning,
well-known to the New Orleans duellist.
When spoken, it is no longer a question of
sword-skill, or who draws first blood ; but a
challenge giving free licence to kill — whichever
can.

In the present affair it was followed by
silence more profound and more intense than
ever, while the attention of the spectators,
now including the seconds, seemed to redouble
itself.

The only sound heard was a whistling of
wings. The fog had drifted away, and several
large birds were seen circling in the air above,
looking down with stretched necks, as if they,
too, felt interested in the spectacle passing
underneath. No doubt they did ; for they
were vultures, and could see — whether or
not they scented it — that blood was being
spilled.

Once more, also, from the tree tops came
the mocking laughter of the eagle ; and out
of the depths, through long, shadowy arcades
the mournful hooting of the great white owl
fit music for such fell strife.

Disregarding these ominous sounds — each

seeming a deatH warning in itself — the combatants
had once more closed, again and again
crossing sword-blades with a clash that frighted
owl, eagle, and vulture, for an instant causing
them to withhold their vocal accompaniment.

Though now on both sides the contest was
carried on with increased anger, there was not
much outward sign of it. On neither any
rash sword-play. If they had lost temper
they yet had control over their weapons ; and
their guards and points, though perhaps more
rapidly exchanged, displayed as much skill as
ever.

Again Kearney felt surprised at the repeated
thrusts of his antagonist, which kept him all
the time on the defensive, while Santander
appeared equally astonished and discomfited
by that far-reaching arm, straight as a yard-stick,
with elbow never bent. Could the
Creole have but added six inches to his rapier

blade, in less than ten seconds the young
Irishman would have had nearly so much of it
passed between his ribs.

Twice its point touched, slightly scratching
the skin upon his breast, and drawing blood.

For quite twenty minutes the sanguinary
strife continued without any marked advantage
to either. It was a spectacle somewhat painful
to behold, the combatants themselves being a
sight to look upon. Kearney's shirt of finest
white linen, showed like a butcher's ; his
sleeves crimsoned ; his hands, too, grasping
his rapier hilt, the same — not with his own
blood, but that of his adversary's which had
run back along the blade ; his face was spotted
by the drops dashed over it from the whirling
wands of steel.

Gory, too, was the face of Santander ; but
gashed as well. Bending forward to put in a
point, the Creole had given his antagonist a

chance, resulting to himself in a punctured
cheek, the scar of which would stay there for
life.

It was this brought the combat to an end ;
or, at all events, to its concluding stroke.
Santander, vain of his personal appearance, on
feeling his cheek laid open, suddenly lost
command of himself; and with a fierce oath
rushed at his adversary regardless of the consequences.


He succeeded in making a thrust, though
not the one he intended. For having aimed
at Kearney's heart, missing it, his blade
passed through the buckle of the young
Irishman's braces, where in an instant it was
entangled.

Only for half-second ; but this was all the
skilled swordsman required. Now, first since
the fight began, his elbow was seen to bend.
This to obtain room, for a thrust, which was

sent, to all appearance, home to his adversary's
heart.

Everyone on the ground expected to see
Santander fall; for by the force of the blow
and direction Kearney's blade should have
passed through his body, splitting the heart
in twain. Instead, the point did not appear
to penetrate even an inch ! As it touched,
there came a sound like the chinking of coin
in a purse, with simultaneously the snap of a
breaking blade, and the young Irishman was
seen standing as in a trance of astonishment,
in his hand but the half of a sword, the
other half gleaming amongst the grass at his
feet.

It seemed a mischance, fatal to Florence
Kearney, and only the veriest dastard would
have taken advantage of it. But this Santander
was, and once more drawing back, and
bringing his blade to tierce, he was rushing on

his now defenceless antagonist, when Written
called " Foul play ! " at the same time
springing forward to prevent it.

His interference, however, would have been
too late, and in another instant the young
Irishman would have have been stretched lifeless
along the sward, but for a second individual
who had watched the foul play — one who had
been suspecting it all along. The sword of
Santander seen flying ofl", as if struck out of his
grasp, and his arm dropping by his side, with
blood pouring from the tips of his fingers, were
all nearly simultaneous incidents, as also the
crack of a rifle and a cloud of blue smoke suddenly
spurting up over one of the carriages, and
half concealing the colossal figure of Oris Rock,
still seated on the box. Out of that cloud
came a cry in the enraged voice of the Texan,
with words which made all plain —

Ye darned Creole cuss ! Take that for a

treetur an' a coward ! Strip the skunk ! He's
got sumtliin' steely under his shirt ; I heard the
chink o' it."

Saying which he bounded down from the
box, sprang over the water ditch, and rushed
on towards the spot occupied by the combatants.


In a dozen strides he was in their midst, and
before either of the two seconds, equally astonished,
could interfere, he had caught Santander
by the throat, and tore open the breast
of his shirt !

Underneath was then seen another shirt, not
flannel, nor yet linen or cotton, but link-enchain
steel !

A Disgraced DUELLIST.

'Possible to describe the scene
which followed, or the expression
upon the faces of those men who
stood beside Santander, The Texan, strong ashe
was big, still kept hold of him, though now
at arm's length ; in his grasp retaining the
grown man with as much apparent ease as
though it were but a child. And there, sure
enough, under the torn flannel shirt all could

see a doublet of chain armour, impenetrable
to sword's point as plate of solid steel !

Explanation this of why Carlos Santander
was so ready to take the field in a duel, and
had twice left his antagonist lifeless upon it.
It explained also why, when leaping across the
water-ditch, he had dropped so heavily upon
the farther bank. Weighted as he was, no
wonder.

By this time the two doctors, with the pair
of hackney drivers, seeing that something had
turned up out of the common course, parting
from the carriages, had also come uj^on the
ground ; the surveys, in sympathy with Oris
Rock, crying " Shame !" In the Crescent city
even a cabman has something of chivalry in his
nature — the surroundings teach and invite it —
and now the detected scoundrel seemed without
a single friend. For he — hitherto acting as
such, seeing the imposture, which had been

alike practised on himself, stepped up to his
principal, and looking him scornfully in the
face, hissed out the word " Ldche /"

Then turning to Kearney and Crittenden he
added :

Let that be my apology to you, gentlemen.
If you're net satisfied with it, Fm willing
and ready to take his place — with either of

you."

It's perfectly satisfactory, monsieur," frankly
responded the Kentuckian, " so far as I'm
concerned. And, I think, I may say as much
for Captain Kearney."

Indeed, yes," assented the Irishman, adding
: " We absolve you, sir, from all blame.
It's evident you knew nothing of that shining
panoply, till now," as he spoke pointing to the
steel shirt.

The French Creole haughtily but courteously,
bowed thanks ; then facing once more to Santander,

and repeating the " Lace" strode
silently away from the ground.

They had all mistaken the character of the
individual, who, despite a somewhat forbidding
face, was evidently a man of honour, as he had
proved himself.

What dye welsh me to do wi' him V interrogated
the Texan, still keeping Santander
in firm clutch. " Shed we shoot or hang him ?"

Hang r simultaneously shouted the two
hackney drivers, who seemed as bitter against
the disgraced duellist as if he had " bilked "
them of a fare.

So I say, too," solemnly pronounced the
Texan ; " Shooting's too good for the like o' him
a man capable o' sech a cowardly, murderous
trick deserves to die the death o' a dog."

Then with an interrogating look at Written
he added : " Which isn't to be, lootenant?"

Neither, Oris " ; answered the Kentuckian.

If I mistake not, the gentleman lias lead enough
punishment without either. If he's got a spark
of shame or conscience ."

Conscience," exclaimed Rock, interrupting.
Sech a skunk don't know the meaning' o' the
word. Darn ye !" he continued, turning upon
his prisoner, and shaking him tiU the links in
the steel shirt chinked, " I feel as if I ked drive
the blade o' my bowie inter ye through them
steel fixing an' all."

And drawing his knife from its sheath he
brandished it in a menacing manner.

Don't, Rock ! Please don't " interposed the
Kentuckian, Kearney joining in the entreaty.
He's not worth anger, much less revenge. So
let him go."

You're right thar, loo tenant," rejoined
Rock. *' He ain't worth either, that's the
truth. An 'twould only be putting risen on the
blade o' my knife to smear it wi' his black blood.

Fer all, I aunt a wine to let him off so easy 's
all that, unless you an the captain insists on it.
After the warmish work he's had, an the sweat
he's put himself in by the wearing' o' two shirts
at a time, I guess he won't be any the worse of
a sprinkling o' cold water. So here goes to gie
it him."

Saying which, he strode off towards the ditch,
half-dragging, half-carrying Santander along
with him.

The cowed and craven creature neither made
resistance, nor dared. Had he done so, the
upshot was obvious. For the Texan's blade,
still bared, was shining before his eyes, and he
knew that any attempt on his j)^rt either to
oppose the latter's intention or escape, would
result in having it buried between his ribs.
So, silently, sullenly, he allowed himself to betaken
along, not as a lamb to the slaughter,
but a wolf, or rather dog, about to be chastised
for some wilful malfeasance.

In an instant after the chastisement was
administered by the Texan laying hold of him
with both hands, lifting him from off his feet,
and then dropping him do^ii into the water
ditch, where, weighted with the steel shirt, he
fell with a dead, heavy plunge, going at once
to the bottom.

That's less than your deserving," said the
Texan, on thus delivering his charge. " An'
if t had been left to Oris Rock 'twould a' been
up, stead o' doom, he'd a sent ye. If ever man
deserved hanging', you're the model o' him. Ha
ha — ha ! Look at the skunk now !"

The last words with the laugh preceding
them, were excited by the ludicrous appearance
which Santander presented. He had come to
the surface again, and with some difficulty,
owing to the encumbrance of his under-shirt,
clambered out upon the bank. But not as
when he went under. Instead, with what appeared

a green cloak over his shoulders, the
scum of the stagnant water long collecting undisturbed.


The hackney driver — there was but one now,
the other taken off by Duperon who had hired
him, their doctor too — joined with Rock in his
laughter, while Kearney, Crittenden, and their
own surgeon could not help uniting in the
chorus. Never had tragic hero suffered a more
comical discomfiture.

He was now permitted to withdraw from the
scene of it, a permission of which he availed
himself without further delay ; first retreating
for some distance along the Shell road, as one
wandering and distraught ; then, as if seized by
a sudden thought, diving into the timbered
swamp alongside, and there disappearing.

Soon after, the carriage containing the victorious
party rattled past ; they inside it scarce
casting a look to see what had become of

Santander. He was nothing to them now ; at
best only a thing to be a matter of ludicrous
remembrance. Nor long remained he in their
thoughts ; these now reverting to Texas, and
their necessity for hastening back to the Crescent
City, to make start for " The Land of the
Lone Star".

A Spartan BAND.

[N ancient days Sparta had its Thermopylae,
while in those of modern
date Sicily saw a thousand men in
scarlet shirts make landing upon her coast, and
conquer a kingdom defended by a military force
twenty or thirty times their number !

But deeds of heroism are not alone confined
to the history of the Old World. That of the
new presents us with many pages of a similar

kind, and Texas can tell of achievements not
surpassed, either in valour or chivalry, by any
upon record. Such was the battle of San
Jacent, where the Texans were victorious,
though overmatched in the proportion of ten to
one : such the defence of Fort Alamo when the
brave Colonel Crockett, now world-known, surrendered
up his life, alongside the equally brave
Jim Bowie," he who gave his name to the
knife which on that occasion he so efficiently
wielded — after a protracted and terrible struggle
dropping dead upon a heap of foes who had felt
its sharp point and keen edge.

Among the deeds of great reno^Ti done by
the defenders of the young Eepubhc, none may
take higher rank, since none is entitled to it,
than that known as the battle of Mier. Though
they there lost the day — a defeat due to the
incapacity of an ill-chosen leader — they won
glory eternal. Every man of them who fell had

first killed his foeman — some half a score —
while of those who survived there was not one
so craven as to cry " Quarter 1" The white flag
went not up till they were overwhelmed and
overpowered by sheer disparity of numbers.

It was a fight at first with rifles and musketry
at long range ; then closer as the hostile host
came crowding in upon them ; the bullets sent
through windows and loop-holed walks — some
from the flat parapets roofs of the houses —
till at length it became a conflict hand to hand
with knife, sword, and pistol, or guns clubbed
being empty, with no time to reload them
many a Texan braining one antagonist with
the butt of his piece after having sent its bullet
through the body of another !

Vain all ! Brute strength, represented by
superior numbers, triumphed over warlike
prowess, backed by indomitable courage ; and
the " Mier Expedition," from which Texas had

expected so much, ended disastrously, though
ingloriously ; those who survived being made
prisoners and carried off to the capital of
Mexico.

Of the Volunteer Corps, which composed
this ill-fated expedition — and they were indeed
all volunteers — none gave better account of itself
than that organised in Poydras-street, New
Orleans, and among its individual members
no man behaved than he whom they had chosen
as their leader. Florence Kearney had justified
their choice and proved true to the trust, as all
who outlived that fatal day ever after admitted.
Fortunately he himself was among the survivors
; by a like good luck, so too were his
first-lieutenant Crittenden and Oris Rock. As
at "Fanning's Massacre," so at Mier the
gigantic Texan performed prodigies of valour,
laying around him, and slaying on all sides,
till at length wounded and disabled, like a

lion beset by a chevaux-de-frise of CafFre
assegais, he was compelled to submit. Fighting
side by side, with the man he had first
taken a fancy to on the Levee of New Orleans,
and afterwards became instrumental in making
captain of his corps — finding this man to be
what he had conjecturally believed and pronounced
him — of the " true grit " — Oris Rock
now felt for Florence Kearney almost the
affection of a father, combined with the grand
respect which one gallant soul is ever ready to
pay another. Devotion, too, so strong and
real, that had the young Irishman called upon
him for the greatest risk of his life, in any
good or honourable ca-use, he would have responded
to the call without moment's hesitancy
or murmur. Nay, more than risk ; he would
have laid it down, absolutely, to save that of
his cherished leader.

Proof of this was, in point of fact, afforded

but a short while after. Any one acquainted
with Texan history "^-ill remember how the
Mier prisoners, while being taken to the city
of Mexico, rose upon their guards and mastering
them, made their escape to the mountains
around. This occurred at the little to^\Ti of El
Salado, and was caused by the terrible sufferings
the captives had endured upon the march,
added to many insults and cruelties, to which
they had been subjected, not only by the
Mexican soldiers, but the officers having them
in charge. These had grown altogether unsupportable,
at El Salado reaching the climax.

It brought about the crisis for a long time
accumulating; and which the Texans anticipated.
For they had, at every opportunity
afforded them, talked over and perfected a
plan of escape.

By early daybreak on a certain morning, as
their guards were carelessly lounging about an

idle hour before continuing that toilsome
journey — a signal shout was heard.

Now boys ; up and at them ! " were the
words, with some others following, which all
well understood — almost a repetition of the
famous order of Wellington at Waterloo. And
as promptly obeyed ; for on hearing it the
Texans rushed at the soldiers of the escort,
wrenched from them their weapons, and with
those fought their way through the hastily-formed
ranks of the enemy out into the open
country.

So far they had succeeded, though in the
end, for most of them, it proved a short and
sad respite. Pursued by an overwhelming
force — fresh troops drawn from the garrisons
in the neighbourhood, added to the late
escort so shamefully discomfited, and smarting
under the humiliation and defeat — the
pursuit carrying them through a country to

which they were entire strangers — a district
almost uninhabited, without roads, and, worse
still, without water, — not strange that all, or
nearly all, of them were recaptured, and carried
back to El Salado.

Then ensued a scene worthy of being enacted
by savages, for little better than savages were
those in whose custody they were. Exulting
fiendlike over their recapture, at first the word
went round that all were to be executed ; this
being the general wish of their captors. No
doubt the deed of wholesale vengeance would
have been done, and our hero, Florence Kearney,
with his companion Oris Rock, never more have
been heard of; in other words, the novel of
the "Free Lances" would not have been
written. But among those reckless avengers
there were some who knew better than to
advocate indiscriminate slaughter. It was
a far cry to Loch Awe," all knew ; the Highland

loch typified not by Texas, but the United
States. But the more knowing ones always
knew that, however far, the cry might be
heard, and then what the result ? No mere
band of Texan filibusters, ill organised, and
but poorly equipped, to come across the Rio
Grande ; instead a well-disciplined army in
numbers enough for sure retaliation, bearing
the banner of the '' Stars and Stripes ".

In fine, a more merciful course was determined
upon ; only decimation of the prisoners
every tenth man to suffer death.

There was no word about degrees in their
guiltiness — all were alike in this respect —
and the fate of each was to be dependent on
pure blind chance.

When the retaken escapade had been
brought back to El Salado, they were drawn
up in line of single file, and carefully counted.
A helmet, snatched from the head of one of the

dragoons guarding them, was made use of asa
ballot box. Into this were thrown a number
of what we call French or kidney beans — the
pijolos of Mexico — in count corresponding to
that of the devoted victims. Of these poles
there are several varieties, distinguishable
chiefly by their colour. Two sorts are common,
the black and white ; and these were
chosen to serve as tickets in that dread lottery
of life and death. For every nine white beans
there was a black one; he who drew black
would be shot within the hour !

Into the hard soldier's head-piece, appropriate
for such purpose, the beans were dropped, and
the drawing done as designed. I, who now
write of it long after, can truthfully affirm that
never in the history of human kind has there
been a grander exhibition of man's courage
than was that day given at El Salado. The
men who exemplified it were of no particular

nation. As a matter of course, the main body
of the Texans were of American birth, but
among them were also Englishmen, Scotchmen,
Irishmen, French, and Germans — even some
who spoke Spanish, the language of their
captors, now their judges, and about to become
their executioners. But when that helmet of
horrible contents was carried round, and held
before each, not one showed the slightest fear
or hesitancy to plunge his hand into it, though
knowing that what they should bring up between
their fingers might be the sealing of their
fate. Many laughed and made laughter among
their comrades, by some qimmtjeit cV esprit. One
reckless fellow — no other than Oris Rock — as he
fearlessly rattled the beans about, cried aloud :
"AVal, boys; I guess it's the tallest gambling
I've ever took a hand at. But this child aunt
afeard. I was born to good luck, an' am not
likely to go under — jest yet."

The event justified his confidence, as he
drew hank — not black, the fatal colour.

It was now Kearney's turn to undergo the
dread ordeal ; and, without flinching, he was
about to insert his hand into the helmet, when
the Texan, seizing hold of it, stayed him.

"No, cap. !" he exclaimed; "I'm wounded,
putty bad, as ye see " — (he had received a
lance thrust in their struggle with the guards)
"an' mayest git over it. Therefor, your life's
worth modern mine. Besides, my luck's good
jest now. So let me take your chance. That's
allowed, as these skunks lev saved themselves."

So it was — a declaration having been made
by the officer who presided over the drawing
from humane motives as pretended — that
any one who could find a substitute might
himself stand clear. A grim mockery it
seemed ; and yet it was not so ; since, besides
Oris Rock, more than one courageous fellow



proposed the same to comrade and friend — in

the case of two brothers the elder one insisting

upon it.

Though fully, fervently appreciating the

generous offer, Florence Kearney was not the

man to avail himself of it.

"Thanks, brave comrade!" he said, with

warmth, detaching his hand from the Texan's

grasp, and thrusting it into the helmet.
What's left of your life yet is worth more

than all mine ; and my luck may be good as

yours — we'll see."

It proved so, a murmur of satisfaction running
along the line as they saw his hand drawn
out with a white bean between the fingers.

"Thanks to the Almighty!" joyously
shouted the Texan, as he made out the colour.
Both o' us char o' that scrape, by Job ! Anas
there aunt no need for me dying' yet, I mean
to live it out, an' git well again."



And get well he did, despite the long after
march, with all its exposures and fatigues ; his
health and strength being completely restored
as he stepped over the threshold, entering
within his prison cell in the City of Mexico.

THE ACOEDADA.

NE of the most noted " lions " in the
City of Mexico is the prison called
La Acordada. Few strangers visit
the Mexican capital without also paying a
visit to this celebrated penal establishment,
and few who enter its gloomy portals issue
forth from them without having seen something
to sadden the heart, and be ever afterwards
remembered with repugnance and pain.

There is, perhaps, no prison in the universal
world where one may witness so many, and
such a variety of criminals ; since there is no
crime knoT\TL to the calendar that has not been
committed by some one of the gaol-birds of
the Acordacla.

Its cells, or cloisters — for the building was
once a monastery — are usually well filled with
thieves, forgers, ravishers, highway robbers,
and a fair admixture of murderers ; none
appearing cowed or repentant, but boldly
brazening it out, and even boasting of their
deeds of villany, fierce and strong as when
doing them, save the disabled ones, who suffer
from wounds or some loathsome disease.

Nor is all their criminal action suspended
inside the prison walls. It is carried on
within their cells, and still more frequently in
the court-yards of the ancient convent, where
they are permitted to meet in common and

spend a considerable portion of their time.
Here they may be seen in groups, most of
them ragged and greasy, squatted on the flags,
card-playing — and cheating when they can —
now and then quarrelling, but always talking
loud and cursing.

Into the midst of this mass of degraded
humanity were thrust two of the unfortunate
prisoners, taken at the battle of Mier — the two
with whom our tale has alone to do.

For reasons that need not be told most of
the captives were excepted from this degradation
; the main body of them being carried on
through the city to the pleasant suburban
village of Tacubaya.

But Florence Kearney and Oris Rock were
not among the exceptions ; both having been
consigned to the horrid pandemonium we have
painted.

It was some consolation to them that they

were allowed to share the same cell, though
they would have liked it better could they
have had this all to themselves. As it was,
they had not ; two individuals being bestowed
in it along with them.

It was an apartment of but limited dimensions
— about eight feet by ten — the cloister of
some ancient monk, who, no doubt, led a jolly
enough life of it there, or, if not there, in the
refectory outside, in the days when the Acorn
was a pleasant place of residence for
himself and his cowled companions. For his
monastery, as " Bolton Abbey in the olden
time," saw many a scene of good cheer, its
inmates being no anchorites.

Besides the Texan prisoners, its other occupants
now were men of Mexican birth. One
of them, under more favourable circumstances,
would have presented a fine appearance. Even
in his prison garb, somewhat ragged and

squalid, he looked the gentleman and something
more. For there was that in his air
and physiognomy, which proclaimed him no
common man. Captivity may hold and make
more fierce, but cannot degrade the, lion. And
just as a lion in its cage seemed this man in a
cell of the Acordada. His face was of the
rotund type, bold in its expression, yet with
something of gentle humanity, seen when
searched for, in the profound depths of a dark
penetrating eye. His complexion was a clear
olive, such as is common to Mexicans of pure
Spanish descent, the progeny of the Conquis-tutors
; his beard and moustache coal-black, as
also the thick mass of hair that, bushing out
and down over his ears, half concealed them.

Cris Rock " cottoned" to this man on sight.
Nor liked him much the less when told he had
been a robber ! Cris supposed that in Mexico
a robber may sometimes be an honest manor

at all events, have taken to the road through
some supposed wrong — personal or political.
Freebooting is less a crime, or at all events,
more easy of extenuation in a country whose
chief magistrate himself is a freebooter ; and
such, at this moment, neither more nor less
was the chief magistrate of Mexico, Don
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

Beyond the fact, or it might be only suspicion,
that Euperto Eivas was a robber, little
seemed to be kno^Ti of him among the inmates
of the Acordada. He had been there only a
short while, and took no part in their vulgar,
common-place ways of killing time ; instead
staying within his cell. His name had, however,
leaked out, and this brought up in the
minds of some of his fellow prisoners certain
reminiscences pointing to him as one of the
road fraternity ; no common one either, but
the chief of a band of " salteadores ".

Altogether different was the fourth personage,
entitled to a share in the cell appropriated
to Kearney and Oris Rock; unlike the reputed
robber as the Satyr: to Hyperion. In short
a contrast of the completest kind, both
physically and mentally. No two beings
claiming to be of human kind could have
presented a greater dissimilarity — being very
types of the extreme. Rupert Rivas, despite
the shabby habiliments in which the
gaol authorities had arrayed him, looked all
dignity and grandeur, while El Zorillo — the
little fox, as his prison companions called
him — was an epitomised impersonation of
wickedness and meanness ; not only crooked
in soul, but in body — being in point of fact
an enano or dwarf hunchback.

Previous to the arrival of those who were
henceforth to share their cell, this ill-assorted
pair had been kept chained together, as much

by way of punishment as to prevent escape.
But now, the gaol governor, as if struck by
a comical idea, directed them to be separated,
and the dwarf linked to the Texan Colossus
thus presenting a yet more ludicrous contrast
of couples — while the ex-captain of the
filibusters and the reputed robber were consigned
to the same chain.

Of the new occupants of the cloister,
Cris Rock was the more disgusted with the
situation. His heart was large enough to
feel s}Tiipathy for humanity in any shape,
and he would have pitied his deformed fellow-prisoner,
but for a deformity of the latter
worse than any physical ugliness ; for the
Texan soon learnt that the hideous creature,
whose couch as well as chain he was forced
to share, had committed crimes of the most
atrocious nature, among the rest murder !
It was, in fact, for this last that he was now

in the Acordada — a cowardly murder, too —
a case of poisoning. That he still lived was
due to the proofs not being legally satisfactory,
though no one doubted of his having
perpetrated the crime.

At first contact with this wretch the Texan
had recoiled in horror, without knowing aught
of his past. There was that in his face which
spoke a history of dark deeds. But when this
became known to the new denizens of the cell,
the proximity of such a monster was positively
revolting to them.

Vengeance itself could not have devised a
more effective mode of torture. Oris Rock
groaned under it, now and then grinding his
teeth and stamping his feet, as if he could have
trodden the misshapen thing into a still more
shapeless mass under the heels of his heavy
boots.

For the first two days of their imprisonment

in the Acordada neither of the Texans could
understand why they were being thus punished
as it were to satisfy some personal spite.
None of the other Mier prisoners, of whom
several had been brought to the same gaol,
were submitted to a like degradation. True,
these were also chained two and two ; but to
one another, and not to Mexican criminals.
Why, then, had they alone been made an exception
? For their lives neither could tell or
guess, though they gave way to every kind of
conjecture. It was true enough that Oris Kock
had been one of the ringleaders in the rising at
El Salado, while the young Irishman had also
taken a prominent part in that affair. Still
there were others now in the Acordada who had
done the same, receiving treatment altogether
different. The attack upon the guards, therefore,
could scarce be the cause of what they
were called upon to suffer now ; for besides the

humiliation of being chained to criminals, they
were otherwise severely dealt with. The food
set before them was of the coarsest, with a
scarcity of it ; and more than once the gaoler,
whose duty it was to look after them, made
mockery of their irksome situation, jesting on
the grotesque companionship of the dwarf and
giant. As the gaol governor had shown, on his
first having them conveyed to their cells, signs
of a special hostility, so did their daily attendant.
But for what reason neither Florence
Kearney, nor his faithful comrade, could divine.
They learnt it at length — on the third
day after their entrance within the prison.
All was explained by the door of their cell
being drawn open, exposing to view the face
and figure of a man well known to them.
And from both something like a cry escaped,
as they saw standing without, by the side
of the gaol governor — Carlos Santander.

A Colonel IN FULL FEATHER.

ES ; outside the door of their cell was
Carlos Santander. And in full war
panoply, wearing a magnificent uniform,
mali a glittering sword by his side, and
on his head a cocked hat, surmounted by a
panache of white ostrich feathers !

To explain his presence there, and in such
guise, it is necessary to return upon time and
state some particulars of this man's life not yet

before the reader. As already said, he was a
native of New Orleans, but of Mexican parentage,
and regarding himself as a Mexican citizen.
Something more than a mere citizen, indeed ;
as previous to his encounter with Florence
Kearney he had been for a time resident in
Mexico, holding some sort of appointment under
that Government, or from the Dictator himself
Santa Anna. What he was doing in New
Orleans no one exactly knew, though among
his intimates there was an impression that he
still served his Mexican master, in the capacity
of a secret agent — a sort of procurator, or spy.
Nor did this suspicion do him wrong ; for he
was drawing pay from Santa Anna, and doing
work for him in the States, which could scarce
be dignified with the name of diplomacy.
Proof of its vile character is afforded by the
action he took among the volunteers in Poy-
dras- Street. His presenting himself at their

rendezvous, getting enrolled in the corps, and
offering as a candidate for the captaincy, were
all done under instructions, and with a design
which, for wickedness and cold-blooded atrocity,
was worthy of Satan himself. Had he succeeded
in becoming the leader of this ill-fated
band, for them the upshot might have been no
worse ; though it would not have been better ;
since it was his intention to betray them to the
enemy at the first opportunity that should
offer. Thwarted in this intent ; knowing he
could no longer show his face among the filibusters,
even though it were but as a private in
the ranks ; fearing furthermore the shame that
awaited him in New Orleans soon as the affair
of the steel shirt should get bruited about, he
had hastily decamped from that place and, as
we now know, once more made his way to
Mexico.

Luckily for him, the shirt, or rather under-shirt,


business leaked not out ; at least not to
reach the ears of anyone in the Mexican capital.

Nor, indeed, was it ever much known in New
Orleans. His second, Duperon, for his own
sake not desiring to make it public, had refrained
from speaking of it ; and their doctor,
a close little Frenchman, controlled by Dupe-ron,
remained equally reticent ; while all those
on the other side — Kearney, Crittenden, Rock
and the surgeon — had taken departure for
Texas on the very day of the duel ; from that
time forward having " other fish to fry ".

But there were still the two hackney drivers,
who, no doubt, had they stayed in the Crescent
city in the pursuit of their daily avocation,
would have given notoriety to an occurrence,
curious as it was scandalous.

It chanced, however, that both the Harvey
were Irishmen ; and suddenly smitten with
warlike aspirations — either from witnessing the

spectacle of the duel, or the gallant behaviour
of their young countryman — on that same day
dropped the ribbons, and, taking to a musket
instead, were among the men who composed
the ill-started expedition which came to grief
on the Eio Grande.

So, for the time, Carlos Santander had escaped
the brand of infamy due to his dastardly act.

His reappearance on the scene in such grand
garb needs little explanation. A fairly brave
and skilled soldier, a gainer man than General
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna never wore
sword, and one of his foibles was to see himself
surrounded by a glittering escort. The officers
of his staff were very peacocks in their gaudy
adornment, and as a rule the best looking of
them were his first favourites. Santander on
returning to Mexico, was appointed one of his
aides-de-camp, and being just the sort — a showy
fellow — soon rose to rank ; so that the defeated

candidate for a captaincy of Texan Volunteers,
was now a colonel in the Mexican Army, on the
personal staff of its Commander-in-chief.

Had Florence Kearney and Cris Rock but
known they were to meet this man in Mexico
could they have anticipated seeing him, ashe
was now, at the door of their prison cell —
their hearts would have been fainter as they
toiled along the weary way, and perchance in
that lottery of life and death they might have
little cared whether they drew black or white.

At the sight of him there rose up all at once
in their recollection that scene upon the Shell
Eoad ; the Texan vividly recalling how he had
ducked the caitiff in the ditch, as how he looked
after crawling out upon the bank — mud bedraggled
and covered with the viscous scum, —
in strange contrast to his splendid appearance
now ! And Kearney well remembered the
same, noting in addition a scar on Santander's

cheek — he had himself given — which the latter
vainly sought to conceal beneath whiskers
since permitted to grow their full length and
breadth.

These remembrances were enough to make
the heart of the captive Irishman beat quick, if
it did not quail ; while that of the Texan had
like reason to throb apprehensively.

Nor could they draw any comfort from the
expression on Santander's face. Instead, they
but read there what they might well believe to
be their death sentence. The man was smiling,
but it was the smile of Lucifer in triumph —
mocking, malignant, seeming to say, without
spoken word, but, for all that, emphatically and
with determination,

I have you in my power, and verily you
shall feel my vengeance."

They could tell it was no accident had
brought him thither, no duty of prison inspection

— but the fiendish purpose to flaunt his
grandeur before their eyes, and gloat over the
misery he knew it would cause them. And his
presence explained what had hitherto been a
puzzle to them — why they two were being made
an exception among their captive comrades,
and thrown into such strange fellowship. It
must have been to humiliate them ; as, indeed,
they could now tell by a certain speech which
the gaol-governor addressed to Santander, as
the cell door turned back upon its hinges.

There they are, Senor Colonel ! As you
see, I've had them coupled according to orders.
What a well-matched pair !" he added, ironically,
as his eyes fell upon Oris Rock and the
hunchback. " ^?/ Dios ! It's a sight to draw
laughter from the most sober-sided recluse
that ever lodged within these walls. Ha !
ha ! ha ! "

It drew this from Carlos Santander ; who,

relishing the jest, joined in the " ha ! ha ! "
till the old convent rang with their coarse
ribaldry.

"DO You Earnest.'

Being all this time — only a few
seconds it was — the four men within
the cell preserved silence ; the dwarf,
as the door alone was drawn open, having said
to the gaol governor: '' Buenos Did Excellence
! you're coming to set us free, an't
you?"

A mere bit of jocular bravado ; for, as might
be supposed the deformed wretch could have

little hope of deliverance, save by the gallows,
to which lie had actually been condemned. A
creature of indomitable pluck, however, this had
not so far frightened him as to hinder jesting —
a habit to which he was greatly given. Besides,
he did not believe he was going to the
garota. Murderer though he was, he might
expect pardon, could he only find money sufficient
to pay the price, and satisfy the conscience
of those who had him in keeping.

His question was neither answered nor himself
taken notice of; the attention of those
outside being now directed upon the other
occupants of the cell. Of these only two had
their faces so that they could be seen. The
third who was the reputed robber, kept his
turned towards the wall, the opened door being
behind his back ; and this attitude he preserved,
not being called upon to change it, till Santander
had closed his conversation with Oris Kock

and Kearney. He had opened it in a jaunty,
jeering tone, saying :

Well ; my brave Filibusters ! Is this
where you are ? Caspita ! In a queer place
and queer company, too ! Not so nice, Senor
Don Florencio, as that you used to keep in
the Crescent city. And you, my Texan
Colossus ! I take it you don't find the atmosphere
of the Acordada quite so pleasant as the
fresh breezes of prairieland, eh ? "

He paused, as if to note the effect of his
irony ; then continued :

'' So this is the ending of the grand Mier
Expedition, with the further invasion of Mexico
! Well ; you've found your way to its
capital, anyhow; if you haven't fought it. And
now you're here, what do you expect, pray 1 "

Not much o' good from such a scoundrel as
you," responded Rock, in a tone of reckless
defiance.

What ! No good from me ! An old acquaintance
— friend, I ought rather to call
myself, after the little scene that passed between
us on the shores of Pontchartrain.
Come, gentlemen ! Being here among strangers
you should think yourselves fortunate in
finding an old comrade of the filibustering
band ; one omne you so many obligations.
Ah ! well ; having the opportunity now, I shall
try my best to wipe out the indebtedness."

You kin do your earnest," rejoined Rock
in the same sullen tone. " We don't look for
marcy at your hands howsomever. It ain't in
ye ; an if t war, Oris Rock 'ud scorn to claim
it. So ye may do yur croTvdng on a dunghill,
what there be cocks like to be scared at it.
Thar aunt needy one o' that sort hear."

Santander was taken aback by this unlocked
for rebuff. He had come to the Acordada to
indulge in the luxury of a little vapouring

over his fallen foes, whom he knew to be there,
having been informed of all that had befallen
them from Mier up to Mexico. He expected
to find them cowed, and eager to crave life
from him ; which he would no more have
granted than to a brace of dogs that had bitten
him. But so far from showing any fear, both
prisoners looked a little defiant ; the Texan
with the air of a caged wolf seeming ready to
tear him if he showed but a step over the
threshold of the cell.

Oh ! very well," he returned, making light
of what Rock had said. " If you won't accept
favours from an old, and, as you know, tried
friend, I must leave you so without them.
But," he added addressing himself more directly
to Kearney :

You, Senor Irlandes — surely you won't be
so unreasonable ?"

*' Carlos Santander," said the young Irishman

looking his ci-devant adversary full in the
face. *' As I proved you not worth thrusting
with my sword, I now pronounce you not
worth words — even to call you coward —
though that you are from the crown of your
head to the soles of your feet. Not even
brave when your body is encased in armour.
Dastard I I defy you."

Though manifestly stung by the reminder,
Santander preserved his coolness. He had
this, if not courage — at least a knack of feigning
it. But again foiled in the attempt to
humble the enemy, and moreover dreading
exposure in the eyes of the gaol-governor — an
old military — should the story of the steel
shirt come out in the conversation, he desisted
questioning the Tejanos. Luckily for him
none of the others there understood English —
the language he and the Texans had used
in their brief, but sharp exchange of words.

Now addressing himself to the governor, he
said —

As you perceive, Senor Don Pedro, these
two gentlemen are old acquaintances of mine,
whose present unfortunate position I regret,
and would gladly relieve. Alas ! I fear the
law will take its course."

At which commiserating remark Don Pedro
smiled grimly ; well aware of the sort of interest
Colonel Santander took in the pair of
prisoners committed to his care. For the order
so to dispose of them he knew to have come
from Santander himself ! It was not his place
nor was he the kind of man to inquire into
motives ; especially when these concerned his
superiors. Santander was an officer on the
staff of the Dictator, besides being a favourite
at Court. The gaol-governor knew it, and was
subservient. Had he been commanded to
secretly strangle the two men thus specially

placed in his charge, or administer poison to
them, he would have done it without pity or
protest. The cruel tyrant who had made him
governor of the Acordada knew his man, and
had already, as rumour said, with history to
confirm it, more than once availed himself of
this means to get rid of enemies, personal or
political.

During all this interlude the robber had
maintained his position and silence, his face
turned to the blank wall of the cloister, his
back upon all the others. "What his motive
for this was neither of the Texans could tell ;
and in all likelihood Santander knew not himself
any more who the man was. But his behaviour,
from its very strangeness, courted inquiry ;
and seemingly struck with it, the staff-colonel,
addressing himself to the gaol-governor, said :

By the way, Don Pedro, who is your
prisoner, who makes the fourth in this curious

quartette ? He seems shy about showing his
face, which would argue it an ugly one like my
own."

A bit of badinage in which Carlos Santander
oft indulged. He knew that he was anything
but ill-favoured as far as face went.

Only a gentleman of the road — un salvador"
responded the governor.

An interesting sort of individual then,"
said Santander. " Let me scan his countenance,
and see whether it be of the true brigand
type — a Macaroni or Diavolo."

So saying he stepped inside the cell, and
passed on till he could see over the robber's
shoulder, who now slightly turning his head,
faced towards him. Not a word was exchanged
between the two, but from the looks it was
clear they were old acquaintances, Santander
starting as he recognised the other ; while his
glance betrayed a hostility strong and fierce ass

that felt for either Florence Kearney or the
Texan. A slight exclamation, involuntary,
but telling of anger, was all that passed his
lips as his eyes met a pair of other eyes which
seemed to pierce his very heart.

He stayed not for more ; but turning upon
his heel, made direct for the door. Not to
reach it however without interruption. In his
hurry to be gone, he stumbled over the legs of
the Texan, that stretched across the cell, nearly
from side to side. Angered by the obstruction
he gave them a spiteful kick, then passed on
outward. By good fortune fast and far out of
reach, otherwise Oris Kock, who sprang to his
feet, and on for the entrance, jerking the dwarf
after, would in all probability, there and then
have taken his life.

As it was the gaol-governor seeing the danger,

suddenly shut the cloister door, so saving it.

*' Jest as I've been tellin' ye all along, Cap,"


coolly remarked Rock, as the slammed door
ceased to make resonance ; " We sled a hanged
the skunk, or shot him thar an then on the
Shell Eoad. 'War a foolish thing letting' him
out o' that ditch when I had him in it. Darn
the luck o' my not drowning' him outright !
We're like to sup sorrow for it now."

F the dramatis personae of our tale,
already known to our reader, Carlos
Santander, Florence Kearney, and
Cris Rock were not the only ones who had
shifted residence from the City of New Orleans
to that of Mexico. "Within the months intervening
two others had done the same — these
Don Ignacio Valverde and his daughter. The
banished exile had not only returned to his

native land, but his property had been restored
to him and himself reinstated in the favour of
the Dictator.

More still, he had now higher rank than ever
before ; since he had been appointed a Minister
of State.

For the first upward step on this progressive
ladder of prosperity, Don Ignacio owed all to
Carlos Santander. The handsome aide-de-camp,
having the ear of his chief, found little
difficulty in getting the ban removed with
leave given the refugee — criminal only in a
political sense — to come back to his country.

The motive will easily be guessed. Nothing
of either friendship or humanity actuated Santander.
Alone the passion of love ; which had
to do not with Don Ignacio — but his daughter.
In New Orleans he himself dared no longer
live, and so could no more see Luisa Valverde
there. Purely personal then ; a selfish love

such as he could feel, was the motive for his
intercession with the political chief of Mexico
to pardon the political criminal. But if he had
been the means of restoring' Don Ig;nacio to his
country, that was all. True, there was the
restitution of the exile's estates, but this followed
as a consequence on reinstatement in his
political rights. The after honours and emoluments
— with the appointment to a seat in the
Cabinet — came from the Chief of the State,
Santa Anna himself. And his motive for thus
favouring a man who had lately, and for long,
been his political foe was precisely the same as
that which actuated Carlos Santander. The
Dictator of Mexico as famed for his gallantries
in love as his gallantry in war — and indeed
somewhat more — had looked upon Luisa Val-verde,
and " saw that she was fair ".

For Don Ignacio himself, as the recipient of
these favours, much may be said in extenuation.

Banishment from one's native land,
with loss of property, and separation from
friends as from best society ; condemned to
live in another land, where all these advantages
are unattainable, amidst a companionship
uncongenial ; add to this the necessity of
work, whether mental or physical toil, to support
life — the res cmgustce domi ; sum up all
these, and you have the history of Don
Imacio Valverde during; his residence in New
Orleans. He bore all patiently and bravely,
as man could and should. For all he was
willing — and it cannot be wondered at that
he was — when the day came, and a letter
reached him bearing the State seal of the
Mexican Eepublic — for its insignia were yet
unchanged — to say that he had received pardon,
and could return home.

He knew the man who had procured it for
him — Carlos Santander — and had reason to

suspect something of the motive. But the
mouth of a gift horse must not be too narrowly
examined ; and Santander, ever since that
night when he behaved so rudely in Don
Ignacio's house, had been chary in showing
his face. In point of fact, he had made but
one more visit to the Calle de Casa Calvo here,
presenting himself several days after the duel,
with a patch of court plaister on his cheeky
and his arm in a sling;. An invalid, interesting
from the cause which made him an invalid, he
gave his own account of it, knowing there was
but little danger of its being contradicted.
Duperon's temper, he understood, with that of
the French doctor, securing silence. The
others were all G.T.T. (gone to Texas), the
hack-rivers, as he had taken pains to assure
himself. No fear, therefore, of what he alleged
getting denial or being called in question.
It was to the effect that he had fought

Florence Kearney, and given more and worse
wounds than he himself had received — enough
of them, and sufficiently dangerous ; to make
it likely that his adversary would not long
survive.

He did not say this to Luisa Valverde — only
to her father. When she heard it second-hand,
it came nigh killing her. But then the informant
had gone away — perhaps luckily for
himself — and could not further be questioned.
When met again in Mexico months after, he
told the same tale. He had no doubt, however,
that his duelling adversary, so terribly
gashed as to be in danger of dying, still lived.
For an American paper which gave an account
of the battle of Mier, had spoken of Captain
Kearney in eulogistic terms, while not giving
his name in the death list, this Santander had
read. The presumption, therefore, was of
Kearney being among the survivors.

Thus stood tidings in the city of Mexico at
the time the Mier prisoners entered it, as
relates to the persons who have so far found
place in our story — Carlos Santancler, a colonel
on the staff of the Dictator ; Don Ignacio
Valverde, a Minister of State ; his daughter, a
reigning belle of society, with no aspirations
therefore, but solely on account of her beauty ;
Florence Kearney, late captain of the Texan
Jilibusters, with Cris Rock, guide, scout, and
general skirmishes of the same — these last shut
up in a loathsome prison, one linked leg to leg
with a robber, the other sharing the chain of a
murderer, alike crooked in soul as in body !

That for the Texan prisoners there was yet
greater degradation in store — one of them,
Kearney, was made aware the moment after
the gaol-governor had so unceremoniously shut
the door of their cell. The teaching of Don
Ignacio in New Orleans had not been thrown

away upon him ; and these, with the practice
since accruing through conversation with the
soldiers of their escort, had made him almost a
master of the Spanish tongue.

Carlos Santander either did not think of
this, or supposed the cloister door too thick to
permit of speech in the ordinary tone passing
through it. It did, notwithstanding ; what he
said outside to the governor reaching the
Irishman's ear, and giving him a yet closer
clue to that hitherto enigma — the why he and
Oris Rock had been cast into a common gaol,
among the veriest and vilest of malefactors.

The words of Santander were —

As you see, Senor Don Pedro, the two
Tejanos are old acquaintances of mine. I met
them not in Texas, but the United States —
New Orleans — where we had certain relations ;
I need not particularize you. Only to say
that both the gentlemen left me very much in

their debt ; and I now wish, above all things,
to wipe out the score. I hope I may count
upon you to help me 1 "

There could be no mistaking what he meant.
Anything but a repeal of friendly services, in
the way of gratitude ; instead, an appeal to
the gaol-governor to assist him in some scheme
of vengeance. So the latter understood it, as
evinced by his rejoinder —

Of course you can, Senor Colonel. Only
say what you wish done. Your commands are
sufficient authority for me."

Well," said Santander, after an interval
apparently spent in considering. " As a first
step, I wish you to give these gentlemen an
airing in the street ; not alone the Tejanos,
but all four."

Caspita ! " exclaimed the governor, with
a look of feigned surprise. " They ought to
be thankful for that."

They won t, however. Not likely ; seeing
their company, and the occupation I want
them put at."

Which is ? "

A little job in the zancas ! "

In which street ? ''

The Calle de Plateros. I observe that its
stones are up."

And when ? "

To-morrow — at midday. Have them there
before noon, and let them be kept until night,
or, at all events, till the procession has passed.
Do you quite understand me ? "

I think I do, Senor Colonel. About their
jewellery — is that to be on ? "

Every link of it. I want them to be
coupled, just as they are now — dwarf to giant,
and the two grand gentlemen together."

Bueno ! It shall be done."

So closed the curious dialogue, or, if continued,

what came after it did not reach the
ears of Florence Kearney ; they who conversed
having sauntered off beyond his hearing.
When he had translated what he heard to Oris
Kock, the latter, like himself, was uncertain as
to what it meant. Not so either of their
prison companions, who had likewise listened
to the conversation outside — both better comprehending
it.

Bueno, indeed !" cried the dwarf, echoing
the gaol-governor's exclamation. " It shall be
done. Which means that before this time
tomorrow, we'll all four of us be up to
our middle in mud. Won't that be nice ?
Ha ! ha ! ha ! "

And the imp laughed, as though instead of
something repulsive, he expected a pleasure of
the most enjoyable kind.

ON THE Azote.

N the city of Mexico the houses
are flat roofed, the roof bearing
the name of azote. A para-petted
wall, some three or four feet in
height, runs all round to separate those
of the adjacent houses from one another
when they chance to be on the same
level, and also prevent falling ofi". Privacy,
besides, has to do with this protective
screen ; the azote being a piece of almost

daily resort, if the weather be fine, aud
a favourite lounging place, where visitors
are frequently received. This peculiarity
in dwelling-house architecture has an oriental
origin, and is still common among
the Moors, as all round the Mediterranean.
Strange enough, the Conquistadores found
something very similar in the New World
conspicuously among the Mexicans — where
the Aztecs houses were flat or terrace
topped. Examples yet exist in Northern
and New Mexico, in the towns of the
Pecos Tunis, and Moquis. It is but natural,
therefore, that the people who now
call themselves Mexicans should have followed
a pattern thus furnished them by
their ancestry in both hemispheres.

Climate has much to do with this sort
of roof, as regards its durability ; no sharp
frosts or heavy snows being there to affect

it. Besides, in no country in the world
is out-door life more enjoyable than in
Mexico, the rainy months excepted ; and
in them the evenings are dry. Still,
another cause contributes to make the roof
of a Mexican house a pleasant place of
resort. Sea coal and its smoke are things
there unknown ; indeed chimneys, if not
altogether absent, are few and far between ;
such as there are being inconspicuous. In
the siempre-verano (eternal spring) of Ana-hac
there is no call for them ; a wood
fire here and there kindled in some 
being a luxury of a special kind,
indulged in only by the very delicate, or
very rich. In the kitchens charcoal is the
commodity employed, and as this yields no
visible sign the outside atmosphere is preserved
pure and cloudless as that which
overhung the Hesperides.

A well appointed azote is provided with
pots containing shrubs and evergreen plants;
some even having small trees, as the orange,
lime, amelia, ferns, and palms ; while
here and there one is conspicuous by a
mirador (belvedere) arising high above the
parapet to afford a better view of the
surrounding country.

It would be difficult to find landscape
more lovely, or more interesting, than that
which surrounds the city of Mexico. Lookin
what direction one will, the eye is furnished
nth a feast. Plains, verdant and
varied in tint, from the light green of
the milpas (young maize), to the more
sombre maguey plants, which, in large
plantations (magueyals) occupy a considerable
portion of the surface — fields of chile
pepper and frijoles (kidney beans) — here

and there wide sheets of water between,



glistening silver-like under the sun — bounding
all a periphery of mountains, more than
one of their summits white with never-melting
snow. The grandest mountains
too, since they are the Cordilleras of the
Sierra Madre or main Andean chain, which
here parted by some Plutonic caprice, in
its embrace the beautiful valley of Mexico,
elevated more than seven thousand feet
above the level of the sea.

Surveying it from any roof in the city
itself, the scene is one to delight the eye
and gladden the heart. And yet on the
azote of a certain house or rather in the
mirador above it, stood a young lady,
who looked over it without delight in her
eye or gladness in her heart. Instead, the
impression upon her countenance told of
thoughts that besides being sad, dwelt not
on the landscape or its beauties.

Luisa Valverde it was, thinking of another
land, beautiful too, where she had passed
several years in exile ; the last of them
marked by an era the sweetest and happiest
of her life. For it was there she first
loved ; Florence Kearney being he who
had won her heart. And the beloved
one — where was he now ? She knew not ;
did not even know whether he still lived.
He had parted from her without giving
any clue, though it gave pain to her —
ignorant of the exigencies which had ruled
his sudden departure from New Orleans.
He had told her, however, of his becoming
captain of the volunteer band ; which, as
she soon after became aware, had proceeded
direct to Texas. Furthermore, she
had heard all about the issue of the ill-fated
expedition ; of the gallant struggle
made by the men composing it, with the

havoc caused in their ranks ; of the survivors
being brought on to the city of
Mexico and the cruel treatment they had
been submitted to on the march ; of their
daring attempt to escape from the guards,
its successful issue for a time, till their
sufferings among the mountains compelled
them to a second surrender — in short
everything that had happened to that
brave band of which her lover was one
of the leaders.

She had been in Mexico throughout all
this ; for shortly after the departure of the
volunteers for Orleans, her father had received
the pardon we have spoken of.
And there she had been watching the
Mier Expedition through every step of its
progress, eagerly collecting every scrap of
information relating to it published in the
Mexican papers ; with anxious heart, straining

her ears over the lists of killed and
wounded. And when at length the account
came of the shootings at El Salado,
apprehensively as ever scanned she that
death-roll of nigh twenty names — the decimated
; not breathing freely until she had
reached the last, and saw that no more
among these was his she feared to find.

So far her researches were, in a sense,
satisfactory. Still she was not satisfied.
Neither to read or hear word of him — that
seemed strange ; was so in her way of
thinking. Such a hero as he, how could
his name be hidden ? Gallant deeds were
done by the Tejanos, their Mexican enemies
admitting it. Surely in these Don Florencio
had taken part, and borne himself
bravely "? Yes, she was sure of that. But
why had he not been mentioned ? And
where was he now?

The last question was that which most
frequently occupied her mind, constantly
recurring. She could think of but one
answer to it ; this saddening enough. He
might never have reached the Eio Grande,
but perished on the way. Perhaps his
life had come to an inglorious though not
ignominious end— by disease, accident, or
other fatality — and his body might now belying
in some lonely spot of the prairies
where his marching comrades had hastily
buried it.

More than once had Luisa Valverde given
way to such a train of reflection during
the months after her return to Mexico.
They had brought pallor to her cheeks and
melancholy into her heart. So much, that
not all the honours to which her father
had been restored — not all the compliments
paid to herself, nor the Court gaieties in



which she was expected to take part —
could win her from a gloom that seemed
likely to become settled on her soul.

S a rule, people of melancholy
temperament, or with a sorrow
at the heart, give way to it
within doors, in the privacy of their own
apartments. The daughter of Don Ignacio
had been more often taught to assuage hers
upon the house-top, to which she was accustomed
to ascend daily, staying there for
hours alone. For this she had opportunity

; her father busied with State affairs
spending most of his time — at least during
the diurnal hours — at Government headquarters
in the Palcvcio,

On this day, however, Luisa Valverde
mounted up to the azote with feelings,
and under an impulse, very different from
that hitherto actuating her. Her behaviour,
too, was different. When she made her
way up and took stand inside the Mirador,
her eyes instead of wandering all
around, or resting dreamily on the landscape,
nth no care for its attractions,
were turned in a particular direction, and
became fixed ujDon a single point. This was
where the road, running from the city to
Tacubaya, alongside the aqueduct of ,
parts from the latter, diverging
abruptly to the left. Beyond this point
the causeway, carried on among maguey

plants, and Peruvian pepper trees, cannot
be seen from the highest house-top in
the city.

Why on this day, more than any other,
did the young lady direct her glance to
the bend in the road, there keeping it
steadfast ? For what reason was the expression
upon her countenance so different
from that of other days ? No listless look
now ; instead an earnest eager gaze as
though she expected to see some one,
whose advent was of the greatest interest
to her. It could only be the coming of
some one, as one going would have been
long since visible by the side of the aqueduct.


And one she did expect to come that
way ; no grand cavalier on prancing steed,
but a simple pedestrian — in short, her own
servant. She had sent him on an errand

to Tacubaya, and was now watching for,
and awaiting his return. It was the
nature of his errand which caused her to
look for him so earnestly.

On no common business had he been
despatched, but one of a confidential character,
and required tact in its execution.
But Jose, a mestizo whom she had commissioned,
possessed this, besides having
her confidence, and she had no fear of
his betraying her. Not that it was a
life or death matter ; only a question of
delicacy. For his errand was to enquire,
whether among the Texan prisoners taken
to Tacubaya one was called Florence
Kearney.

As it was now the third day after their
arrival in Mexico, it may be wondered
why the young lady had not sought this
information before. The explanation is easy.

Her father owned a country house in the
environs of San Augustine, some ten miles
from the city ; and there staying she had
only the day before heard that the captive
train, long looked for, had at length
arrived. Soon as hearing it, she had hastened
her return to town, and was now
taking steps to ascertain whether her lover
still lived.

She did not think of making inquiry
at the Accorded, though a rumour had
reached her that some of the prisoners
were there. But surely not Don Florencio
! If alive, it was not likely he
would be thus disgraced : at least she
could not believe it. Little dreamt she
of the malice that was moving, and in
secret, to degrade in her eyes the man
who was uppermost in her thoughts.

And as little suspected she when one

of the house domestics came upon the
azote and handed her a large ornamental
envelope, bearing the State arms, that it
was part of the malignant scheme.

Breaking it open she drew out an
embossed and gilded card — a ticket. It
came from the Dictator, inviting Dona
Luisa Valverde to be present in a grand
procession, which was to take place on the
following day ; intimating, moreover, that
one of the State carriages would be at
the disposal of herself and party.

There were but few ladies in the city
of Mexico who would not have been
flattered by such an invitation ; all the
more from the card bearing the name,
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, signed by
himself, with the added phrase " con asthma
particular ".

But little cared she for the flattery.

Father did it cause her a feeling of disgust
; with something akin to fear. It
was not the first time for the ruler of
Mexico to pay compliments and thus press
his attentions upon her.

Soon as glancing over, she let the despised
thing fall, almost flinging it at her
feet ; and once more bent her eyes upon
the Tacubaya road, first carrying her glance
along the side of the aqueduct to assure
herself that her messenger had not in the
meanwhile rounded the corner.

He had not, and she continued to watch
impatiently ; the invitation to a ride in
the State carriage being as much out of
her mind as though she had never received
it.

Not many minutes longer before being
intruded on. This time, however, by no
domestic; instead a lady — like herself,

young and beautiful, but beauty of an
altogether different style. Though of pure
Spanish descent, Lucia Valverde was a
guerra ; her complexion bright, with hair
of sunny hue. Such there are in Mexico,
tracing their ancestry to the shores of
Biscay's famous bay.

She who now appeared upon the azote
was dark ; her skin showing a tinge of
golden brown, with a profusion of black
hair plaited and coiled as a coronet around
her head. A crayon-like shading showed
upon her ujDper lip — which on that of a
man would have been termed a moustache —
rendering whiter by contrast teeth already
of dazzling whiteness ; while for the same
reason, the red upon her cheeks was of
the deep tint of a damask rose. The
tones of all, however, were in perfect harmony
; and distributed over features of the

finest mould produced a face in which soft
feminine beauty vied with a sort of savage
picturesqueness, making it piquantly attractive.


It was altogether a rare bewitching face ;
part of its witchery being due to the rata
Andalusian — and beyond that the Mor-scan
— but as much of it coming from the
ancient blood of Analyse — possibly from
the famed Malice herself. For the young
lady delineated was the Condesa Almonte
descended from one of conquistadors who
had wedded an Aztec princess — the beautiful
Ysabel Almonte, whose charms were
at this time the toast of every cercle in
Mexico.

Chapter XVI.

A MUTUAL Misapprehension.

Lisa Valverde and Ysabel Almonte
were fast friends — so fondly intimate
that scarcely a day passed
without their seeing one another and exchanging
confidences. They lived in the
same street ; the Condesa having a house
of her own, though nominally owned by
her grandcourt and guardian. For, besides
being beautiful and possessed of a title —



one of the few still found in Mexico,
relics of the old regime — Ysabel Almonte
was immensely rich ; had houses in the
city, haciendas in the country, property
everywhere. She had a will of her own
as well, and spent her wealth according
to her inclinations, which were all on the
side of generosity, even to caprice. By
nature a light-hearted, joyous creature, gay
and merry, as one of the bright birds of her
country, it was a rare thing to see sadness
upon her face. And yet Luisa Valverde,
looking down from the mirador, saw that
now. There was a troubled expression
upon it, excitement in her eyes, attitude
and gestures, while her bosom rose and
fell in quick pulsations. True, she had
run up the escalera — a stair of four flights —
without pause or rest ; and that might
account for her laboured breathing. But

not for the flush on her cheek, and the
sparkle in her eyes. These came from a
different cause, though the same one which
had carried her up the long stairway
without pausing to take breath.

She had not enough now left to
declare it ; but stood panting and speechless.


Madre de Diosf' exclaimed her friend
in an accent of alarm. '' What is it,
Ysabel ? "

Madre de Dios ! I say too," gasped the
Condesa. " Oh, Luisita ! what do you
think ? "

What ? "

They've taken him — they have him in
prison ! "

He lives then — still lives ! Blessed bethe
Virgin!"

Saying which Luisa Valverde crossed her

arms over her breast, and with eyes raised
devotionally towards Heaven, seemed to
offer up a mute, but fervent thanksgiving.


Still lives ! " echoed the Condesa, with
a look of mingled surprise and perplexity.

Of course he does ; surely you did not
think he was dead ! "

Indeed I knew not what to think — so
long since I saw or heard of him. Oh,
Fm so glad he's here, even though in a
prison ; for while there's life there's hope."

By this the Condesa had recovered
breath though not composure of countenance.
Its expression alone was changed,
from the look of trouble to one of blank
astonishment. What could her friend mean?
Why glad of his being in a prison ?
For all the while she was thinking of a
him.

Hope ! " she ejaculated again as an echo,
then remaining silent, and looking dazed-like.

Yes, Ysabel ; I had almost despaired of
him. But are you sure they have him
here in prison. I was in fear that he
had been killed in battle, or died upon
the march, somewhere in those great
prairies of Texas "

Carramba ! " interrupted the young
Countess, who, free of speech, was accustomed
to interlacing it with her country
forms of exclamation.

What's all this about prairies and
Texas ? So far as I know, Euperto was
never there in his life."

Euperto ! " echoed the other, as the
joy which had so suddenly lit up her
features as suddenly returning to shadow.
I thought you were speaking of Florencio."


They understood each other now. Long
since had their love secrets been mutually
confessed ; and Luisa Valverde needed no
telling who Euperto was. Independent of
what she had lately learned from the
Condesa, she knew him to be a gentleman
of good family, a soldier of some
reputation ; but who — as once her own
father — had the misfortune to belong to
the party now out of power ; many of
them in exile, or retired upon their estates
in the country — for the time taking no
part in politics. As for himself, he had
not been lately seen in the city of Mexico,
though it was said he was still in the
country ; as rumour had it, hiding away
somewhere among the mountains. And
rumour went further, even to the defiling
of his fair name. There were reports of
his having become a robber, and that,

under another name he was now chief of
a band of salteadores, whose deeds were
oft heard of on the Acapulco Eoad, where
this crosses the mountains near that place
of many murders — the Cruel Marques.

Nothing of this sinister tale, however,
had reached the ears of Don Ignacio's
daughter. Nor till that day — indeed that
very hour — had she, more interested in
him, heard aught of it. Hence much of
the wild excitement under which she was
labouring.

Forgive me, Ysabel ! " said her friend,
opening her arms, and receiving the Countess
in sympathetic embrace, "forgive me
for the mistake I have made."

Nay, 'tis I who should ask forgiveness,"
returned the other, seeing the misapprehension
her words had caused, with their
distressing effect. " I ought to have

spoken plainer. But you know how much
my thoughts have been dwelling on dear
Euperto."

She did know, or should, judging by
herself, and how hers had been dwelling
on dear Florencio.

But, Ysabel : you say they made him
a prisoner ! Who has done that and
why ? "

The soldiers of the State. As to
why, you can easily guess. Because he
belongs to the party of Liberals. That's
why and nothing else. But they don't
say so. I've something more to tell you.
Would you believe it, Luisita, that they
accuse him of being a salvador"

*^ I can believe him accused of it — some
of those in power now are wicked enough
for anything — but not guilty. You remember
we were acquainted with Don

Rupert, before that sad time when we
were compelled to leave the country. I
should say he would be the last man to
stain his character by becoming a robber."

The very last man ! Robber indeed !
My noble Rupert the purest of patriots,
purer than any in this degenerate land.
Ay-demi ! "

"Where did they take him and when?"

Somewhere near San Augustin, and I
think, several days ago, though I've only
just heard of it."

'estrange that. As you know, I've
been staying at San Augustin for the
last week or more ; and there was no
word of such a thing there."

Not likely there would be ; it was all
done quietly. Don Rupert has been
living out that way up in the mountains,
hiding, if you choose to call it. I know

where, but no matter. Too brave to be
cautious, he liacl come clown to San
Augustin. Some one betrayed him, and
going back he was waylaid by the soldiers,
surrounded and made prisoner. There
must have been a whole host of them,
else they'd never have taken him so easily.
I'm sure they wouldn't and couldn't."

And where is he now, Ysabel ? "

In prison as I've told you."

But what prison ? "

That's just what I'm longing to know.
All I've yet heard is that he's in a
prison under the accusation of being a
highwayman. Santissima ! " she added,
angrily stamping her tiny foot on the
tesselated flags. " They who accuse him
shall rue it. He shall be revenged on
them. I'll see justice done him myself.
Ah ! that will I, though it costs me all

I'm worth. Only to think — Euperto a
robber I My Euperto ! Volga me Dios ! "

By this, the two bad mounted up into
the mirador — the Senorita Valverde having
come down to receive ber visitor. And
there, the first flurry of excitement over,
they talked more tranquilly, or at all
events more intelligibly of the affairs mutually
affecting them. In those there was
much similarity, indeed, in many respects a
parallels. Yet the feelings with which they
regarded them were diametrically opposite.
One knew that ber lover was in prison, and
grieved at it ; the other hoped her s might bethe
same, and would have been glad of it !

A strange dissimilitude, of which the
reader has the key.

Beyond what she had already said, the
Condesa had little more to communicate,
and in ber turn became the questioner.

I can understand now, amiga mia,
why you s23oke of Don Florencio. The
Tejano prisoners have arrived, and you are
thinking he's amongst them ? That's sois
it not ! "

Not thinking, but hoping it, Isabel"

Have you taken any steps to ascertain
? "

"I have."

'^ In what way ? "

I've sent a messenger to Tacubaya, where
I'm told they've been taken."

Not alL Some of them have been
sent elsewhere. One party, I believe, is
shut up in the Acordada."

What ? in that fearful place ! among
those horrid wretches — the worst criminals
we have ! The Tejans are soldiers —
prisoners of war. Surely they do not deserve
such treatment ? "

Deserve it or not, some of them are
receiving it. That grand gentleman,
Colonel Carlos Santander — your friend by
the way — told me so."

The mention of Santander's name, but
more a connection with the subject spoken
of, produced a visible effect on Luisa
Valverde. Her cheek seemed to pale,
and suddenly flushed red again. Well she
remembered, and vividly recalled, the old
enmity between him and Don Florencio.
Too well, and a circumstance of most
sinister recollection as matters stood now.
She had thought of it before ; was thinking
of it all the time, and therefore the
words of the Condesa started no new
train of reflection. They but intensified
the fear she abbacy felt, for a time holding
her speechless.

Not noticing this, and without waiting

a rejoinder, the other ran on, still interrogating
:

Whom have you trusted with this
delicate mission, may I ask ? "

"Only Jose."

Well ; Jose, from what I've seen of
him, is worthy of the trust. That is sofar
as honesty is concerned, and possibly
cleverness. But, amiga mia, he's only a
humble servitor, and out there in Tacu-
baya, among the garrison soldiers, or if it
be in any of the prisons, he may experience
a little difficulty in obtaining the
information you seek. Did you give him
any money to make matters easy ? "

He has my purse with him, with
permission to use it as he may see best."

Ah ! then you may safely expect his
bringing back a good account, or at all
events one that will settle the question

you wish to have settled. Your purse
should be a key to Don Florencio's prison —
if he be inside one anywhere in Mexico."

'•'Oh! I hope he is."

Wishing your amante in a prison !
That would sound strange enough ; if one
didn't understand it."

I'd give anything to know him there —
all I have to be assured he still lives."

Likely enough you'll soon hear. When
do you expect your messenger to be
back?"

At any moment. He's been gone
many hours ago. I was watching for
him when you came up — yonder on the
Tacubaya Eoad. I see nothing of him
yet, but he may have passed while we've
been talking."

Muy amiga mia ! How much our
doings this day have been alike. I, too,

have despatched a messenger to find out
all about Rupert, and am now awaiting
his return. I ran across to tell you of
it. And now that we're together let us
stay till wee know the worst or the best.
God help us both ; for, to make use of
the phrase I've heard among farmers,
we're ^ both in the same boat '. What is
this ? ' " she added, stooping, and taking
up the gilded card which had been all
the while lying upon the floor. " Oh,
indeed ! Invitation to an airing in one of
the State carriages — with such a pretty
compliment appended ! How free El
Excellentissimo is with his flattery. For
myself I detest both him and it. You'll go,
won't you ? "

I don't wish it."

No matter about wishing ; I want you.
And so will your father, I'm sure."

But why do you want me ? "
Why, so that you may take me with you."
I would rather wait till I hear what
father says."

That's all I ask, amiga. I shall be
contented with his dictum, now feeling
sure — "

She was interrupted by the pattering of
feet upon the stone stairway ; two pairs
of them, which told that two individuals
were ascending. The heavy tread proclaimed
them to be men. Presently their
faces showed over the baluster rail, and
another step brought them upon the roof.
Both ladies regarding them with looks of eager
inquiry, glided down out of the mirador to
meet them.

For they were the two messengers that had
been despatched separately, though on errands

so very similar.



Returning they had met by the front door,
and entered the house together. Each having
had orders to deliver his report, and without
delay, was now acting in obedience to them.

Two and two they stood upon the azote,
the men, hat in hand, stood in front of
their respective mistresses ; not so far apart,
but that each mistress might have heard what
the servant of the other said ; for on their
part there was no wish or reason for concealment.


Senorita," reported Jose, " the gentleman
you sent me to enquire about is not in
Tacubaya."

Almost a cry came from Luisa Yalverde's
lips, as with paled cheek, she said —

You've not heard of him, then ? "

But the colour quickly returned at the
answer —

I have, Senorita ; more, I have seen him."

Seen Don Florencio ! — where ? Speak
quick, Jose ! "

In tke Acordada ! "

In the Acordada ! " in still another voice —
that of the Condesa speaking in a similar tone,
as though it were an echo ; for she, too, had
just been told that her lover was in the
same gaol.

I saw him in a cell, my lady," continued
the Countess's man, now taking precedence.
They had him coupled to another prisoner —
aTejano."

He was in one of the cells, Senorita,"
spoke Jose, also continuing his report, "chained
to a robber."

POR LAS ZANCAS

N all cities there is a street favoured

by fashion. This in Mexico is the

Calle de Plateros (street of the

silversmiths), so called because there the

workers in precious metals and dealers in

bijouterie " most do congregate ".

In this street the jones condor (gilded
youth) of modern Tenochtitlan strolled in tight-fitting
patent leather boots, canary-coloured

kid gloves, cane in hand, and quizzing-glass to
the eye. There, too, the snores and senoritas
go shopping bareheaded, with but the shawl
thrown over the crowTi hood fashion.

When out only for promenade, none of
these linger long in the street of the silversmiths.
They but pass through it on their
way to the Alanieda, a sort of half-park, half-garden,
devoted to the public use, and tastefully
laid out in walks, terraces, and parterres
with flowers, and fountains ; grand old evergreen
trees overshadowing all. For in that
summery clime shade, not sun, is the desideratum.
Here the jones comrades spent
part of the afternoons sauntering along the
arcaded walks, or seated around the great
fountain watching the play of its crystal
waters. But with an eye to something
besides — the senoritas, who are there, too,
flirting the fans with a dexterity which speaks

of much practice. Speaks of something more.
Not every movement made by these rustling
segments of circles is intended to create
currents of air, and cool the heated skin.
Many a twist and turn, watched with anxious
eyes, conveys intelligence interesting as words
never spoken. In Mexico many a love tale is
told, passion declared, jealous pang caused or
alleviated, by the mute languages of fans and
fingers.

Though the Calle de Plateros terminates at
the gate of the Alameda, the same line of
street is continued half-a-mile further on, to
the fashionable drive of the Pasco Nuevo,
sometimes called Pasco de Buccareli, from the
Viceroy who ruled New Spain when it was laid
out. It is the Rotten Eow of Mexico, for it is
a ride as well as a drive ; and at a certain hour
of the afternoon a stream of carriages, with
strings of horsemen, may be seen tending

towards it, the carriages drawn, some of
them by mules, others by the small native
horses, and a distinguished few by large
English or American animals, there known as
prisoner. It is the top thing to have a pair
of ''frisones''.

In the carriages, the snores and senoritas
are seen attired in their richest robes — full
evening dress — bare-armed and bare-headed,
their hair, usually black, ablaze with jewels
or entwined with flowers fresh picked — the
sweet-scented suche, the white star-like jasmine,
and crimson grenadine. Alongside ride
the cavaliers, in high-peaked, stump-leather
saddles, their steeds capering and prancing ;
each rider, to all appearance, requiring the
full strength of his arms to control his mount,
while insidiously using his spurs to render the
animal uncontrollable. The more it pitches
and plunges the better he is pleased, provided

the occupants of the carriages have their
eyes on him.

Every clay in the year — except during the
week of Guaresma (Lent), when capricious
fashion takes him to the Paseo Viejo, or Lav
Vias, on the opposite side of the city — can
this brilliant procession be seen moving along
the Calle de Plateros, and its continuation, the
Calle de San Francisco.

But in this same thoroughfare one may often
witness a spectacle less resplendent, with
groups aught but gay. Midway along the
street runs a deep drain or sewer, not as in
European cities permanently covered up, but
loosely flagged over, the flags removable at
will. This, the zanca, is more of a stagnant
sink than a drainage sewer ; since from the
city to the outside country there is scarce an
inch of fall to carry ofl' the sewage. As a
consequence it accumulates in the zancas till

they are brimming full, and with a stuff
indescribable. Every garbage goes there — all
the refuse of household product is shot into
them. At periodical intervals they are cleared
out, else the city would soon be flood in its
own filth. It is often very near it, the blue
black liquid seen oozing up between the flagstones
that bridge over the zancas, filling the
air with a stench intolerable. Ever recurring
revolutions make the municipal authorities of
Mexico careless about their charge and neglectful
of their duties. But when the scouring-out
process is going on, the sights are still more
offensive, and the smells too. Then the flags
are lifted and laid on one side — exposing all
the impurity — while the stuff is tossed to the
other, there to lie festering for days, or until
dry enough to be more easily removed. For
all it does not stop the circulation of the
carriages. The grand dames seated in them

pass on, now and then showing a slight contortion
in their pretty noses. But they would
not miss their airing in the Paseo were it
twenty times worse — that they wouldn't. To
them, as to many of their English sisterhood
in Hyde Park, the afternoon drive is everything
— to some, as report says, even more than
meat or drink ; since they deny themselves
these for the keeping of the carriage.

It may be imagined that the scouring-out of
the zancas is a job for which labourers are not
readily obtained. Even the plato turns up
his nose at it, and the poorest proletarian will
only undertake the task when starvation is
staring him in the face. For it is not only
dirty, but deemed degrading. It is, therefore,
one of the travaux-forces which, as a matter of
necessity, falls to the lot of the " gaol-bird ".
Convicts are the scavengers ; criminals sentenced
to long periods of imprisonment, of

whom there are often enough in the careless of
Mexico to clean out all the sewers in the
country. Even by these it is a task looked
upon with repugnance, and usually assigned
to them as a punishment for prison derelictions.
Not that they so much regard the dirt
or the smells ; it is the toil which offends
them — the labour being hard, and often
requiring to be done under a hot, broiling sun.
To see them it is a spectacle of a rather
curious kind, though repulsive. Coupled two
and two — for the precaution is taken, and not
unfrequently needed — to keep their leg-chains
on ; up in mud to the middle of their bodies,
and above bespattered nth it — such mud too t
many of them with faces that, even when
clean, are aught but nice to look at ; their
eyes now flashing fierce defiance, now bent
down and sullen, they seemed either at enmity
or out of sorts with all mankind. Some among

them, however, make light of it, bandy words
with the passers-by, jest, laugh, sing, shout,
and swear, which to a sensitive mind but
makes the spectacle more sad.

All this understood, it may well be conceived
with what anxiety Florence Kearney
listened to that snatch of dialogue between
Santander and the gaol governor outside the
cell. He did not even then quite comprehend
the nature of what was intended for them.
But the sharer of his chain did, who soon after
made it all known to him, he passing the
knowledge on to Oris Rock. So when, on the
next morning, the governor again presented
himself at the door of their cell, saying :

Now gentlemen, get ready to take a
little exercise " — they knew what sort of
exercise was meant.

He, however, believing them ignorant of
it — for he was not aware they had overheard

his outdoor speech with Santander,
added ironically :

It's a special favour I'm going to give
you — at the request of Senior Colonel Santander,
who, as I've seen, takes a friendly
interest in some of you. For your health's
sake, he has asked me to give you a turn
upon the streets ; which I trust you will
enjoy and get benefit by."

Don Pedro was a born joker, and felt
conceit in his powers as a satirist. In the
present instance his irony was shameless, being
understood.

The dwarf was the only one who deigned
rejoinder.

Ha, ha, ha ! " he yelled in his wild
unearthly way. " Turn upon the streets !
That's fine for you, Don Pedro. A turn
under the streets — that's what you mean,
isn't it ? "

He had been long enough in the gaol
governor's charge to know the latter's name,
and was accustomed to address him thus
familiarly. The deformed creature was fearless
from his very deformity, which in a
way gave him protection.

Vacate Zorillo" returned the Governor,
slightly put out and evidently a little nettled,
You're too fond of jesting — or trying.
I'll take that out of you, and I mean to
give you a lesson in good manners this
very day." Then fixing his eyes upon Eras,
he added : '' Senor Don Rupert, I should
be only too happy to let you off from the
little excursion your prison companions are
about to make and save you the fatigue.
But my orders are rigorous. They come
from the highest quarters, and I dare not
disobey them."

This was all pure irony, intended but

to torment him ; at least so the robber
seemed to understand it. For, instead of
accepting it in a friendly sense he turned
savagely on his tormentor, hissing out :

'' I know you aren't disobey them, dog
that you are ! Only such as you would be
governor of a gaol like this : you, who
turned coat and disgraced the sword you
wore at Zacatecas. Do your worst, Don
Pedro Arias ! I defy you."

Cascades ! how swelling big you talk,
Senor Capitan Eivas ! Ah ! well. I'll let
a little of the wind out of you too, before
you bid good-bye to the Acordada. Even
the Condesa, grand dame though she is,
won't be able to get you clear of my
clutches so easy as you may be thinking.
La Carrots is the lady likeliest to do that."
After thus spitefully delivering himself,
he called to some prison warders in waiting

in the court outside, and commanded them
to come up to him.

Here," he directed, " take these two
pairs and hand them over to the guard at
the gate. You know what for, Dominique ? "
The. half interrogatory was addressed to a
big, hulking fellow, chief of the turnkeys,
who looked all Acordada.

Por Certo, Senoi^ Governor" he rejoined
with a significant look, after giving
the prison salute to his superior. " I know
all about it."

'' See, moreover, that they be kept all
day at it ; that's my orders."

Sure will I, Senor," was the compliant
rejoinder.

After which the man twitted with turning
his coat, turned his back upon the place
where he had been so ungraciously received,
going off to more agreeable quarters.



Now, gentlemen ! " said the gaoler, stepping
up to the door of the cell, 'for las
Zancas ! "



Tyrant AND TOOL.

L Excellentissimo Bliistrissimo General
Don Jose Antonio Lopez de
Santa Anna.
Such the twice sesquipedalian name and
title of him who at this time wielded
the destinies of Mexico. For more thana
quarter of a century this man had been
the curse of the young Republic — its direst,
deadliest bane. For although this rule was

not continuous, its evil effects were. Unfortunately,
the demoralisation brought about
by despotism, extends beyond the reign or
life of the despot ; and Santa Anna had so
debased the Mexican people, both socially
and politically, as to render them unfitted
for almost any form of constitutional government.
They had become incapable of distinguishing
between the friends of freedom
and its foes ; and in the intervals of Liberal
administration, because the ]millennium did
not immediately show itself, and make all
rich, prosperous and happy, they leaped to
the conclusion that its failure was due to the
existing regime, making no account, or allowance,
for the still uncicatrised wounds of
the body politic being the work of his
wicked predecessor.

This ignorance of political cause and effect
is alas ! not alone confined to Mexico. There

is enough of it in England, too — as in every
other nation. But in the earlier days of
the Mexican Eepublic the baneful weed
flourished with unusual vigour and rankness
to the benefit of Antonio Lopez de Santa
Anna, and the blight of his country. Deposed
and banished so many times that
their number is not easily remembered, he
was ever brought back again — to the wonder
of people then, and the puzzle of historians
yet. The explanation, however, is simple
enough. He reigned through corruption
that he had himself been instrumental in
creating ; through militarism and an abominable
Chaihvinism-r-this last as effective an
instrument as the oppressor can wield.
Divide et impera is a maxim of despotic
state-craft, old as despotism itself ; *' flatter
and rule " is a method equally sure, and
such Santa Anna practised to its full. He

let pass no opportunity of flattering the
national vanity, which brought the Mexican
nation to shame, with much humiliation —
as the French at a later period, and as it
must every people that aims at no higher
standard of honour than what may be derived
from self-adulation.

At the time I am writing of, the chief
of the Mexican Eepublic was aiming at
Imperium " — eagerly straining for it. Its
substance he already had, the " Libertas "
having been long since eliminated from his
system of government, and trodden underfoot.
But the title he had not acquired yet.
He yearned to wear the purple, and be
styled " Imperator," and in order to prepare
his subjects for the change, already
kept a sort of Imperial court, surrounding
it with grand ceremonials. As a matter of
course, these partook of a military character ;

being himself not only political head of the
State, but commander-in-chief of its armies.
As a consequence Falacio, his official residence,
was beset with soldier guards, officers
in gorgeous uniforms loitering about the
gates or going out and in, and in the Piazza
Grande at all times exhibiting the spectacle
of a venerable Champ de Mars. No one
passing through the Mexican metropolis at
this period would have supposed it the chief
city of a Eepublic.

On that same day, in which Carlos Santander
had shown himself at the Acordada,
only at an early hour, the would-be Emperor
was seated in his apartment of the palace
in which he was wont to give audience to
ordinary visitors. He had got through the
business affairs of the morning, dismissed his
Ministers, and was alone when one of the
aides-de-camp in attendance entered with

a card, and respectfully saluting him, laid
it on the table before him.

'' Yes ; say I can see him. Tell him to
come in," lie directed, soon as reading the
name on the card.

In the door on its second opening appeared
Carlos Santander, in the uniform of a colonel
of Hussars, gold bedizened and laced from
collar to cuffs.

Ah ! Senor Don Carlos ! " exclaimed the
Dictator in a joyous, jocular way ; " What's
your affair ? Coming to tell me of some fresh
conquest you've made among the muchachas ?
From your cheerful countenance I should say
it's that."

Excellentissimo ! "

Oh ! you needn't deny, or look so demure
about it. Well, you're a lucky fellow to
be the lady killer I've heard say you are."

Your Excellency, that's only say-say ;

I ought rather to call it slander. I've no
ambition to be thought such a character.
Quite the reverse, I assure you."

If you could assure me ; but you can't.
I've had you long enough under my eye
to know better. Haven't I observed your
little flirtations with quite half-a-score of
our senoritas ; among them a very charming
young lady you met in Louisiana, if I mistake
not."

Saying this, he fixed his eyes on Santander's
face in a searching interrogative way, as
though he himself felt more than a common
interest in the charming young lady who
had been met in Louisiana.

Avoiding his glance, as evading the question,
the other rejoined —

"It is very good of your Excellency to take
such interest in me, and I'm grateful. But I
protest —

*' Come, come ! amigo mio ! No protestations.
'Twould only be adding perjury to
profligacy. Ha ! ha ! ha ! "

And the grand dignitary leaned back in his
chair, laughing. For it was but badinage,
and he in no way intended lecturing the stafl*-
colonel on his morality, nor rebuking him for
any backsliding. Instead, what came after
could but encourage him in such Tvdse, his
chief continuing —

Yes, Senor Don Carlos, I'm aware of your
amourettes, for which I'm not the man to be
hard upon you. In that regard, I myself get
the credit — so rumour says — of living in a
glass house, so I cannot safely throw stories.
Ha! ha!"

The tone of his laugh, with his self-satisfied
look, told of his being aught but angry with
rumour for so representing him.

Well, Excellentissimo," here put in the

subordinate ; 'rit don't much signify what the
world says, so long as one's conscience is
clear."

'' Bravo-hravissimo ! '' exclaimed the Most
Excellent. '• Ha-ha-ha ! " he continued, instill
louder machinations. " Carlos Santander
turned moralist ! And moralizing to me ! It's
enough to make a horse laugh. Ha-ha-ha ! "

The staff colonel appeared somewhat disconcerted,
not knowing what all this might be
tending to. However, he ventured to remark :

I am glad to find your Excellency in such
good humour this morning."

Ah ! that's because you've come to ask
some favour from me, I suppose." Santa Anna
had a habit of interlarding his most familiar and
friendly discourse with a little satire, sometimes
very disagreeable to those he conversed
with. '' But never mind," he rattled on,
though I confess some surprise at your hypocrisy,

wliicli is all thrown away upon me,
amigo ! I don't at all wonder at your success
with the signoritas. You're a handsome
fellow, Don Carlos ; and if it weren't for that

scar on your cheek By the way, you never

told me how you came by it. You hadn't it
when you were last with us."

The red flushed into Santander's face, and
up over his forehead to the roots of his hair.
He had told no one in Mexico, nor an}'TS'here
else, how he came by that ugly thing on his
jaw, which beard could not conceal, and which
lie felt as a brand of Cain.

It's a scar of a sword cut, your Excellency.
I got it in a duel."

"Ah! An honourable wound, then. But
where ? "

In New Orleans."

Just the place for that sort of thing, as I
know, having been there myself." (Santa

Anna had made a tour of the States, on
"parole, after the battle of San Jacent,
where he was taken prisoner.) ''A very den
of duellists is Nuevo Orleans ; many of them
maitres describe. But who was your antagonist
*? I hope you gave him as good as you

got."

I did, your Excellency ; that, and more."

'you killed him?"

Not quite. I would have done so, but
that my second interposed, and persuaded me
to let him off."

Well ; he hasn't let you off, anyhow.
What was the quarrel about ? Carrai ! I
needn't ask ; the old, orthodox cause — a lady,
of course ? "

Nay ; for once your Excellency is in error.
Our desajio originated in something cj^uite
different."

What thing ? "

An endeavour on my part to do a service
to Mexico and its honoured ruler."

Oh, indeed ! In what way, Senor Colonel?"

"That band oi filibuster os, of which, as your
Excellency will remember "

Yes — yes," interrupted Santa Anna impatiently.
He evidently knew all about that,
and preferred hearing no more of it. " It
was one of the filibuster os you fought with, I
suppose ? "

Yes, Excellentissimo ; the one they chose
for their captain."

You were angry at his being preferred to
yourself, and so called him out ? Well ; that
was cause enough to a man of your mettle.
But what became of him afterwards ? Was he
among those at lier ? "

He was."

Killed there ? "

No, your Excellency; only taken prisoner."

Shot at Solace ? "

Neither that, Excellentissimo. "

Then he must be here ? "

He is here, your Excellency."

What's his name ? "

Kearney — Florence Kearney, un Irlandes"

A peculiar expression came over Santa
Anna's features, a sort of knowing look, as
much as to say the name was not new to him.
Nor was it. That very morning, only an hour
before, Don lo-nacio Yalvercle had audience of
him on a matter relating to this same man —
Florence Kearney; in short, to obtain clemency
for the young Irishman — full pardon, if possible.
But the Minister had been dismissed
with only vague promises. His influence at
court was still not very great, and about the
motive for his application — as also who it
originated from — Santa Anna had conceived
suspicions.

Of all this lie said nothing to the man
before him now, simply inquiring :

Is the Irlandes at Tacubaya ? "

No, your Excellency ; he's in the Acorn


Since you had the disposal of the Tejano
prisoners, I can understand that," returned
the Dictator with a significant shrug. " It's
about him, then, you're here, I suppose. Well,
what do you want ? "

Your authority, Excellentissimo, to punish
him as he deserves."

For making that tracing on your cheek,
eh ? You repent not having punished him
more at the time when you yourself had the
power ? Isn't it so, Seiior Colonel ? "

Santander's face reddened, as he made reply :

Not altogether, your Excellency. There's
something besides, for which he deserves to be
treated differently from the others."

Santa Anna could have given a close guess
at what the exceptional something was. To
his subtle perception a little love drama was
gradually being disclosed ; but he kept his
thoughts to himself, with his eyes still searchingly
fixed on Santander's face.

This Kearney," continued the latter,
*' though an Irishman, is one of Mexico's
bitterest enemies, and especially bitter against
your Excellency. In a speech he made to the
Jllihtisteros, he called you an usurper, tyrant,
traitor to liberty and your country — aye, even
coward. Pardon me for repeating the vile
epithets he made use of."

Santa Anna's eyes now scintillated with a
lurid sinister light, as if filled with fire, ready
to blaze out. In the American newspapers he
had often seen his name coupled with such
opprobrious phrases, but never without feeling
savagely wrathful. And not the less that

Hs own innate consciousness told him it was
all as said.

Chingara ! " lie hissed out, for he was not
above using this vulgar exclamation. *' If it
is true what you say, Don Carlos, as I presume
it is, you can do as you like ^\T.th this dog of
an Irlandes ! have him shot, or have him
despatched by La Garrett, which ever seems
best to you. But no — stay ! That won't do
yet. There's a question about these Teens
with the United States Minister ; and as this
Kearney is an Irishman, and so a British
subject, the representative of that country
may make trouble too. So till all this is settled
the Irlandes mustn't be either shot or garrotted.
Instead, let him be treated tenderly.
You comprehend ? "

The staff-colonel did comprehend ; the emphasis
on the " tenderly " made it impossible
for him to mistake the Dictator's meaning,



which was just as he desired it. As he passed
out of the presence, and from the room, his
countenance was lit up, or rather darkened,
by an expression of fiendish triumph. He
now had it in his power to humiliate them
who had so humbled him.

Quite a little comedy ! '' soliloquised Santa
Anna, as the door closed on his subordinate.
In which, before it's played out, I may
myself take a part. She's a charming creature
this Senorita Valverde. But, ah ! nothing to
the Condesa. That woman — witch, devil, or
whatever I may call her — bids fair to do what
woman never did — make a fool of Lopez de
Santa Anna."

A Wooden-legged Lothario.

OR some time the Dictator remained
in his seat lighting cigarrito
after cigarrito, and puffing away
at them furiously. The look of light frivolity
had forsaken his face, which was now overcast
with gloom.

At this time, as said, he wielded supreme
unlimited power over the Mexican people
even to life and death. For although

he might not recklessly or openly decree
this, he could bring it about secretly — by
means which if rumour spoke true, he had
more than once made use of. Indeed, there
stood against his name more than one well-confirmed
record of assassination.

Thought of this may have had something
to do with the cloud that had come over
his features ; though not for any qualms of
conscience for the murders he may have
committed or hired others to commit. More
likely a fear that he himself might some
day meet a similar fate ; like all despots he
dreaded the steel of the assassin. By his
corrupt administration, he had encouraged
bravoes till it had become a dangerous
element in the social life of his country —
almost an institution — and was but natural
he should fear the bravo's blade turned
against himself.

Another apprehension may at this time
have been troubling him. Although to all
appearance secure in the dictatorial chair,
with a likelihood of his soon converting it
into a real throne, he had his misgivings
about this security. By imprisonments, executions,
banishments, and confiscations, he
had done all in his power to annihilate the
liberal party. But though crushed and feeble
now, its strength was but in abeyance, its
spirit still lived, and might again successfully
assert itself. No man knew this better than
he himself ; and no better teacher could he
have had than his o\\ti Hfe's history, with
its alternating chapters of triumph and defeat.
Even then there was report of a provincial
in one of the northern cities of the
EepubHc — the State, by a polite euphemism,
being still so designated. Only a faint
grotto " it was, but with a tone that resembled

the rumbling of distant thunder,
which might yet be heard louder and nearer.
Little, however, of matters either revolutionary
or political was he thinking now.
The subject uppermost in his mind was
that latent on his lips — woman. Not in a
general way, but with thoughts specially
bent upon one of them, or both, with whose
names he had just been making free. As
his soliloquy told, a certain "Condesa" had
first place in his reflections, she being no
other than the Condesa Almonte. In his
wicked way he had made love to this young
lady, as to many others ; but, unlike as
with many others, he had met repulse.
Firm, though without indignation, his advances
not yet having gone so far, nor been
so bold, as to call for this. He had only
commenced skirmishing with her ; a preliminary
stroke of his tactics being that invitation

to ride in the State carriage extended
to Dona Luisita Yalverde, while withheld
from the Countess — an astute manoeuvre on
his part and, as he supposed, likely to serve
him. In short, the old sinner was playing
the old game of " piques ". Nor did he think
himself so ancient as to despair of winning
at it. In such contests he had too often
come off victorious, and success might attend
upon him still. Vain was he of his personal
appearance, and in his earlier days not without
some show of reason. In his youth
Santa Anna would claim to be called, if
not handsome, a fairly good-looking man.
Though a native Mexican, a Vera-cuzco,
he was of pure Spanish race and good blood
the boasted sangre azul. His features
were well formed, oval, and slightly aquiline,
his complexion dark, yet clear, his hair and
moustaches black, lustrous, and profuse. But

for a sister cast in this eyes nbt always
observable, his countenance would have been
pleasing enough. As it was he prided himself
upon it even now that he was well up
in years, and his hair becoming silvered.
As for the moustaches, black pomatum kept
them to their original colour.

One thing soured him, even more than
advancing age — his wooden leg. 'Tis. said
he could never contemplate that without .an
expression of pain coming over his features,
as though there was gout in the leg itself
gi^dng him a twinge. And many the time
nay hundreds of times — did he curse Prince
de Joinville. For it was in defending Vera
Cruz against the French, commanded by the
latter, he had received the wound, which
rendered amputation of the limb necessary.
In a way he ought to have blessed the Prince,
and been grateful for the losing of it rather

than otK^rwdse. Afterwards the mishap stood
him in good stead ; at election times when
he was candidate for the Chief Magistracy
of the State. Then he was proud to parade
the artificial limb ; and did so to some
purpose. It was indeed, an important element
in his popularity, and more than once
proved an effective aid to his reinstatement.
With a grim look, however, he regarded
it now. For though it had helped him
politically, he was not thinking of politics,
and in what he was thinking about he knew
it an obstruction. A woman to love a man
with a wooden leg ! And such a woman as
Ysabel Almonte ! Not that he put it to himself
in that way ; far from it. He had still
too good an opinion, if not of his personal
appearance, at least of his powers otherwise,
and he even then felt confident of success.
For he had just succeeded in removing

another obstacle which seemed likely to be
more in this way than the wooden leg. He
had but late come to know of it ; but as
soon as knowing, had taken measures to avert
the danger dreaded — by causing the imprisonment
of a man. For it was a man he feared,
or suspected, as his competitor for the affections
of the Condesa. It had cost him no
small trouble to effect this individual's arrest,
or rather capture. He was one of the prescribed,
and in hiding ; though heard of
now and then as being at the head of the
band of salvador — believed to have turned
highwayman.

But he had been taken at length, and
was at that moment in the gaol of the
Acordada ; which Santa Anna well knew,
having himself ordered his incarceration there,
and given other instructions regarding him to
the gaol governor, who was one of his creatures.

After sitting for some time, as lie stretched
out his hand, and held the end of his paper
cigar to the red coals burning in a habere
on the table before him, the frown upon his
features changed to a demoniac smile. Possibly
from the knowledge that this man
was now in his power. Sure was he of this ;
but what would he not have given to be assure
of her being so too !

Whether his reflections were sweet or
bitter, or which predominated, he was not
permitted longer to indulge in them. The
door again ojDcning — after a tap asking permission
to enter— showed the same aide decamp.
And on a similar errand as before,
differing only in that now he placed two
cards on the table instead of one ; the cards
themselves being somewhat dissimilar to that
he had already brought in.

And with alto of ether a different air did

Santa Anna take them up for examination.
He was enough interested at seeing by their
size and shape, that those now desiring an
audience of him were ladies. But on reading
the names, his interest rose to agitation ;
such as the aide-de-camp never before had seen
him exhibit, and which so much astonished
the young officer that he stood staring wonderingly,
if not rudely, at the grand dignitary,
his chief His behaviour, however, was not
noticed, the Dictator s eyes being all upon
the cards. Only for an instant though. If
he gave ready reception to his late visitor,
still readier did he seem desirous of according
to those now seeking speech with him.

Conduct the ladies in," was his almost
instantaneous command, as quickly retracted.
For soon as spoken he countermanded it ;
seemingly from some after thought which,
as a codicil, had suddenly occurred to him.

Then followed a chapter of instructions to
the aide-de-camp, confidential, and to the
effect that the ladies were not to be immediately
introduced. He was to keep them
in conversation in the anti-chamber outside,
till he should hear the bell.

Judging by his looks as he went out the
young subaltern was more than satisfied with
the delay thus enjoined upon him. It was
aught but a disagreeable duty ; for, whether
acquainted with the ladies who were in waiting,
or not, he must have seen that both
were bewitching beautiful — one being Luisa
Valverde, the other Ysabel Almonte.

A PAIE OF BEAUTIFUL PETITIONERS.

On as the aide-de-camp had
closed the door behind him, Santa
Anna sprang up from his seat
and hastily stumped it to a large cheval
glass which stood on one side of the
room. Squaring himself before this he
took survey of his person from crown to
toes. He gave a pull or two at his
moustaches, twisting their points, and turning

them upward along his cheeks. Then
running his dangers comb-like, through his
hair, he gave that also a jaunty set. In
fine, straightening himself in his gold-braided
uniform frock, with a last glance
down to his feet — this resulting in a slight
grimace — he returned to the state chair
and reseated himself.

With all his gallantry and politeness —
and to these he made much pretension — it
was not his custom to receive lady visitors
standing. In the upright attitude the
artificial leg made him look stiff", and he
preferred stowing it away under the table.
Besides, there was his dignity, as the grand
figure-head of the nation, which he now
wished to have its full effect. Leaning
forward, he gave a downward blow to the
spring of the table bell; then assuming an
attitude of expectant grandeur, sate expectant.

This time the aide-de-camp required no
passing to and fro ; and the door again
opening, the ladies were ushered into the
august presence.

In their air and manner they betrayed
agitation too, while the serious expression
upon their features told they were thereon
no trivial errand.

Pray be seated, ladies," said the Dictator,
after exchanging salutations with
them. " 'Tis not often the Condesa
Almonte honours the Palacio with her
presence, and for the Senorita Valverde,
were it not for official relations with her
father, I fear we should see even less of
her than we do."

"While speaking he pointed to a couple
of couch chairs that stood near the table.

They sat down rather hesitatingly, and
slightly trembling. Not that either would

have been at all timid had the occasion
been a common one. Both were of Mexico's
best blood, the Condesa one of the
old noblesse who hold their heads fisher
even than the political chief of the state,
when he chances to be — as more than
once has occurred — an adventurer of humbler
birth. Therefore, it was not any awe
of the great dignitary that now unnerved
them, but the purpose for which they
were seeking speech with him. Whether
Santa Anna guessed it, or not, could not
be told by his looks. An experienced
diplomatist, he could keep his features fixed
and immovable as the Sphinx, or play
them to suit the time and the tune. So,
after having delivered himself, as above,
with the blandest of smiles upon his face,
he remained silent, awaiting the rejoinder.

It was the Condesa who made it.


'your Excellency," she said, doing her
utmost to look humble ; "we have come
to beg a favour from you."

A gratified look, like a gleam of light,
illuminated Santa Anna's swarthy features.
Ysabel Almonte begging favours from him !
What better could he have wished ? With all
his command of features he but ill concealed
the triumph he now felt. It flashed up in his
eyes, as he said despondingly,

A favour you would ask ? Well, if it be
within my power to grant it, neither the
Condesa Almonte, nor the DonaLuisa Yalverde
need fear refusal. Be frank, then, and tell me
what it is."

The Countess, with all her courage, still
hesitated to declare it. For despite the
ready promise of compliance, she did fear
a refusal ; since it had been asked for that
same morning and though not absolutely refused,

the answer left but little hope of its
being conceded.

As is known, at an earlier hour Don Imacio
bad paid a visit to the Palacio, to seek clemency
for a prisoner-of-war, Florence Kearney. But
pardon for a state prisoner was also included in
bis application — that being Rupert Eivas. Of
all this the ladies were well aware, since it was
at their instigation, and through their importunity
he had acted. It was only, therefore,
by the urgency of a despairing effort, as a dernier
ressort, these had now sought the presence as
petitioners, and naturally they dreaded denial.

Noting the Condesa s backwardness — a thing,
new but not displeasing to him, since it gave
promise of influence over her — Santa Anna
said interrogatively :

Might this favour, as you are pleased to
term it, have aught to do with a request lately
made to me by Don Ignacio Valverde V

'Tis the same, your Excellency," answered
the Countess at length recovering spirit, but
still keeping up the air of meek supplication
she had assumed.

Indeed !" exclaimed the Dictator, adding,
that grieves me very much."

He made an attempt to look sorry ; though
it needed none for him to appear chagrined.
This he was in reality, and for . reasons intelligible.
Here were two ladies both of whom he
had amatory designs upon, each proclaiming
by her presence — as it were telling him to his
teeth, the great interest she felt in another —
that or she would not have been there !

But why, Excellentissimo ?" asked the
Countess, entreatingly. " What is there to
grieve you in giving their freedom to two men
gentlemen, neither of whom has been guilty
of crime, and who are in prison only for offences
your Excellency can easily pardon ? "

•* Not SO easily as you think, Condesa. You
forget that I am but official head of the State,
and have others to consult — my Ministers and
the Confess — in affairs of such magnitude.
Know, too, that both these men for whom you
solicit pardon have been guilty of the gravest
offences ; one of them a foreigner, an enemy of
our country, taken in arms against it ; the
other, I am sorry to say, a citizen, who has
become a rebel, and worse still, a robber !"

'Tis false !" exclaimed the Countess, all at
once changing tone, and seeming to forget the
place she was in and the presence. '' Don
Rupert Eivas is no robber ; never was, nor
rebel either ; instead the purest of patriots ! "

Never looked Ysabel Almonte lovelier than
at that moment — perhaps never woman. Her
spirit roused, cheeks red, eyes sparkling with
indignation, attitude erect — for she had
started up from her chair — she seemed to

be the very impersonation of defiance, angry,
but beautiful. No longer meek or supplicating
now. Instinct or intuition told
her it would . be of no use pleading further,
and she had made up her mind for the
worst.

The traits of beauty which her excitement
called forth, added piquancy to her natural
charms, and inflamed Santa Anna's wicked
passions all the more. But more than any
of them revenge. For now he knew how
much the fair petitioner was interested in
the man whose suit she had preferred. With
a cold cynicism — which, however, cost him
an effort — he rejoined :

That, perhaps, is your way of thinking,
Condesa. But it remains to be proved —
and the prisoner you speak of shall have
an opportunity of proving it — with his innocence
in every respect. That much I can

promise you. The same for him," he added,
turning to Luisa Valverde, '' in whom, if I
mistake not, the Dona Luisa is more especially
interested. These gentlemen prisoners shall
have a fair trial, and justice done them.
Now, ladies ! can you ask more of me ?"

They did not ; both seeing it would be to
no purpose. Equally purposeless to prolong
the interview ; and they turned toward the
door, the daughter of Don Ignacio, leading
where she had before followed.

This was just as Santa Anna wished it.
Seemingly forgetting of his cork leg, and the
limp he took such pains to conceal, he jerked
himself out of his chair and hurried after —
on a feigned plea of politeness. Just intime
to say to the Countess in a hurried,
half whisper.

If the Condesa will return, and prefer her
request alone, it may meet with more favour."

The lady passed on, with head held disdainfully,
as though she heard but would not
heed. She did hear what he said, and it
brought a fresh flush upon her cheek, with
another flash of anger in her eyes. For she
could not mistake his meaning, and knew
it was as the serpent whispering into the ear
of Eve.
