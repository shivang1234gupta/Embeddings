CHAPTER I.

IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.

It was pitch dark, and long past midnight.
The last train from the City had
just steamed out of Heme Hill railway
station. The air was clear and crisp.
Under foot the ground was dry and
firm with February frost. All the shops
in the neighbourhood had long since
been shut. Few lights burned in the
fronts of private houses. The Dulwich
Eoad was deserted, and looked dreary
and forlorn under its tall, skeleton,
motionless, silent trees. There was nota
sound abroad save the gradually-dying

VOL. I. B

k>

rumble of the train, and the footfalls
and voices of the few people who had
alighted from it. Little by little these
sounds died away, and the stillness was as
great as in the pulseless heart of a calm
at sea.

Alfred Paulton had arrived by the
last train. He was twenty eight years
of age, of middle height, and fair complexion.
He lived in Half Moon Lane,
and after saying good-night to some
acquaintances who came out in the train
with him, turned under the railway viaduct
at Heme Hill, and walked in the
direction of his home.

He was in no hurry, for he knew
his father and mother and sisters had
gone to bed long ago. He had his
latch-key, and should let himself in. His
ulster covered him comfortably from neck
to heel. He had supped pleasantly with
a few friends at his club, the Robin

Hood, and earlier in the day finished, a
very agreeable transaction with his solicitor,
and now had in his pocket a handsome
bundle of notes.

As he walked he swung his stick, and
hummed in a whisper a few bars from
the favourite air of a comic opera which
he had been to hear that evening.

Suddenly he started. As he was directly
opposite the door of a house, standing
back a few yards from the road, the door
opened noisily, and he heard a woman's
voice in a tone of piteous entreaty exclaim :

"Oh, what shall I do — what shall
I do?"

Alfred Paulton drew up and listened.

For a while all was silent.

He looked over the paling, which was
just as high as his chin. In the doorway
of the house stood the figure of a
woman against the light of a lamp on
a table in the hall. The leafless boughs

b 2

of the intervening shrubs prevented his
getting an uninterrupted view, but he
could in a brief glance gather a good deal.
The figure was that of a woman neither
tall nor short, neither stout nor thin.
She was evidently not a servant. She
wore an ordinary indoor costume, and
had nothing on her head. Although she
had scarcely moved since the opening of
the door, he came to the conclusion she
-^was of alert and active habit. He judged
her to be neither old nor young. Her
hair shone raven-black in the lamplight.
'The illumined cheek was finely modelled,
dark in hue — that of a brunette. She
leaned forward into the darkness, and
peered right and left, moving her head
but slightly as she did so. Something
glittered in the starlight at her throat
and at her girdle. Her hands were held
behind her to balance the forward inclination
of her body. On her fingers jewels

sparkled in the lamplight of the hall
behind her.

All this he saw at a glance. He was
perplexed, and did not know how to
act. It was scarcely fair in him to
stand there eaves-dropping, as it were.
If he moved now she would hear him,
and know he had seen her and had
stopped to listen. If he spoke he might
alarm her.

Up to the moment the door opened and
she appeared and called out, he believed
this house to be empty. It had been
vacant for a long time. Now he recollected
having heard that it was let
at last, and that the new tenant was expected
to arrive this day. The place was
called Crescent House. He had heard talk
about the new-comers at the breakfast-table
that morning ; but nothing seemed
known of them except that they came
from a distance and were well off.

The woman in the doorway now
straightened herself, raised both hands to
her forehead, and moaned out in a lower
and more despairing tone her former
words :

Oh, what shall I do— what shall I do f "

He could hesitate no longer. It was
plain she was in a sore strait. He coughed,
advanced to the gate, and, putting his
hand on the latch, said :

I beg your pardon. Is there anything
wrong ? "

She started back a pace into the hall.
In doing so her full face met the lamplight
for a moment. It was a very
beautiful face, full of terror.

Do not be alarmed," he said softly ;
-' I was passing when you opened the
door, and I heard you speak. Is there
anything wrong ? Anything I can do for
you?"

She seemed reassured, and stepped once

more to the threshold, and said, in a quick,
low voice :

"I am a stranger here. I came to this
house only to-day. I am alone with my
husband in the house, and he has been
seized by sudden illness. I do not know
where to find a doctor, even if I could
leave the house, and I cannot go away from
my husband.' 7

In what way can I be of use ? Pray
command me."

He tried to open the gate, but failed.

She perceived his efforts to open the
gate, and once more withdrew a pace into
the hall, crying in alarm :

No, no ; you must not come in ! If
you wish to help me, go for the nearest
doctor. Go at once. Do not stand there.
In heaven's name, do not lose a moment !
Go, I implore you."

She clasped her hands, and held them
out towards him in entreaty.

"As you wish," he said. "I shall not
be many minutes.' '

He turned and ran back towards the
railway station. Dr. Santley, the family
physician of the Paultons, lived close by,
and Alfred Paulton resolved to summon
him, although he might not be exactly
the nearest medical man. Time would be
gained rather than lost by going for him,
as Santley would come at once without
waiting for explanations — that is, if he
were at home.

On his way he had little space to think,
the time being short and the pace quick.
He was more lucky than he had hoped,
for he almost ran over the man he sought
at the gate of his house.

Oh, doctor," he cried, almost breathless,
I am so glad to meet you up and dressed !
I want you, if you will be good enough
to come with me at once."

"Mr. Paulton, I'm sorry. What is the

matter ? I have just come back from
another unexpected patient."

It's no one at our place, thank goodness
! It's some one at Crescent House.
I don't even know the name."

By this time both men were walking
rapidly towards Half Moon Lane.

Dr. Santley was a tall, slender man, with
full black beard and moustaches. He had
a quiet, gentle, responsible manner, and
rarely smiled. As the two strode on
together, Alfred Paulton described the
scene in which he had just taken part.
When he had finished, his companion said :

Ah, I saw the vans at the door to-day ;
but surely they cannot have got a big
house like that straight in so short a time.
Here we are."

They had arrived at the spot where a few
minutes before the younger man had stood
and spoken to the strange woman in the
doorway. The door was now not open.

Paulton rattled noisily at the gate, and
then waited a while. There was no answer.
He looked at the windows of the house;
none was lighted up. Light shone in the
fan-sash over the door.

You cannot have mistaken the house in
the dark?" asked Dr. Santley, suppressing
a yawn.

Impossible ! It was the only house to
be let. It is Crescent House, and you
yourself saw the furniture going in to-day."

Again he rattled the gate, this time as
loudly as he could.

At length the door of the house was
opened slowly, and against the light of
the lamp the same figure as Paulton had
seen before was revealed. Again the woman
stood still on the threshold and leaned out
into the darkness. This time she at once
turned her face towards the gate.

Before either of the men had time to speak,
she said in a calm, low, penetrating voice :

Is the doctor there 2 "

"Yes," answered both in a breath.

I will open the gate in a moment."

With a firm, swift step she left the doorway
and trod the gravelled path leading
to the gate. She did not hesitate or fumble
at the latch. In a few seconds the gate
swung open.

"This is Dr. Santley ; he is our family
physician. He and I live close by. May
I offer you my card? I and my family
will, I am sure, feel delighted to be of
any service to you," said Paulton, raising
his hat.

Stay," she said. " Will you both come
in ? I am terrified. I do not know what
has happened. I hope you are not too late."

Her words were measured and her tone

calm. Although the trees overhead were

leafless, where she stood was dark, and

neither of the men could see her clearly.

Without further w T words she led the way

back to the house. The two men followed
in silence. When they entered the hall she
turned round in the full light of the lamp,
and, stretching out her right arm towards
the first door on the left, said :

"In that room. I shall wait for you.
There is no other light. Take this lamp."

Paulton now saw her fully. She was
dark, almost swarthy. There was no colour
in her cheek. Her forehead was small and
compact. Her eyebrows and hair jet,
glossy. Her eyes were dark, large, a little
sunken, brilliant, and full of suppressed
fire. The nose was slightly aquiline. The
only relief to the dark hue of the face and
the black of the eyebrows, hair, and eyes,
was afforded by the full, red, ripe lips.
And all the features, the forehead, the nose,
the chin, the mouth, the cheeks, were finely
modelled. The face was commanding, imperial,
triumphant. It was as set and firm
as marble. It was the face of an empress

born to lead her legions to victory — of a
woman in whom courage was a matter of
course, who regarded obedience to her wish
as a spontaneous offering. She had the
immortality of indestructible will in her
face, the weight of irresistible determination.


With the face ended the heroic aspect
of the woman.

At her throat blazed the diamonds of a
brooch large as the palm of her hand. On
her fingers glittered a dozen diamond rings.
The belt round her waist was fastened with
a diamond clasp. The diamonds at her
throat held an orange-coloured silk scarf.
The rest of her dress was dead black, close-fitting
to the figure, and full of folds below
the waist. The arms were bare half-way
from the elbow to the wrist. The figure,
the arms, the hands were subduing soft
and feminine. The arms and wrists were
round, the hands exquisitely delicate, with

fine taper fingers, the bust a miracle of rich
symmetry.

It was the head of Boadicea on the figure
of Rosamond.

Dr. Santley took up the lamp from the
hall table and entered the room she had
indicated. Paulton paused for a moment
in doubt as to whether he should go or
stay. The hall lay now in comparative
darkness; there was no light except what
came through the open door of the front
room.

Follow him."

It was her voice.

Paulton obeyed. As he got inside the
doorposts he turned round and looked
back into the hall. He could make out
nothing but the glitter of the diamonds
at her throat, in her girdle, on her fingers.
They were stars against the darkness of
her dress, as the stars abroad in heaven
against the sightless robe of night.

The room in which Dr. Santley and
Paulton found themselves was in the
greatest disorder. In one corner lay the
carpet rolled up, in another the hearth-rug,
fender, fire-irons, and coal-scuttle.
All along the right side stood a row of
chairs, one inverted on another. Pictures
rested on the floor with their faces against
the wall ; the gaselier sprawled close by
the window; the leaves of the dining-table
were set against the folding-doors
at the back. The drawers and pillars of
the sideboard were hard by, the top and
back of it stretched upward into the
gloom of a deep recess ; several boxes
and canvas packages littered the floor.
Two knights in plate-armour reclined one
at each corner of the chimney-piece ; easy-chairs
were wedged in among amorphous
bundles wrapped in Indian matting; rods
and poles protruded from under legs of
chairs, under bales heaped upon one another.

A small table, face down upon another,
held its slender legs up in air. Some
fire still smouldered in the grate ; the fire
must have been large not long ago, for
the room was still warm.

In the centre of the room stood the
dining-table, reduced to its smallest dimensions.
On this were spread the remains
of a simple supper. Close by the table
stood a couch, and on the couch appeared
the figure of a man.

The figure was sitting up in the arm
of the couch, the legs rested on the couch,
the head drooped forward ; the chin and
lower part of the face were buried in
the thick, long, grizzled beard that flowed
down over the chest.

Dr. Santley stepped up to the couch
on which the figure lay, and having
placed the lamp upon the table close at
hand, began his examination. It did not
take long. After a few minutes he turned

to Paulo, and, pointing to the figure,
shook his head.

"Well?" asked the young man below
his breath.

The doctor went up to him and whispered
in his ear :

Dead some time."

Paulton looked round apprehensively at
the door, and whispered back :

"How will she take it?"

The doctor shook his head.

Both men stood staring at one another.

Suddenly both started ; they beard a
footfall behind them. Some one had
entered the room.

VOL. I.

FOUL PLAY ?

The two men turned quickly round. The
light of the . lamp fell on the black dress
of the woman and sparkled on her
diamonds. Her arms hung down by her
side. Both hands were clenched. She
advanced with a steady, slow step, her
eyes firmly fixed on Dr. Santley's face.
She did not glance at Paulton. She did
not glance at the couch.

"You were ]long," she said, in a slow,
constrained voice, " and I came in to
know."

She rested the tips of the fingers of

one hand on the table and kept her eyes
fixed on the doctor.

"I think," said Santley, placing himself
between her and the couch, " that it
would be better if we went into some
other room."

We cannot ; this must serve. All the
other rooms are locked up, except my
bed room, and my husband has the keys."

Her voice did not falter.

Has Mr. , your husband, been long

ill ? "

M My husband's name is Louis Davenport.
He has been ill a long time — years.
He has been suffering from spasmodic
asthma. I can gather from your manner
that there is no hope."

Her voice was firm and clear. No feature
moved but the beautiful, flexible mouth, of
which the lips were as full of colour as
ever.

May I beg of you to be seated ? * Dr.

o 2

Santley left the position he had occupied
and handed her a chair. She sank on it
without speaking. She rested one of her
arms on the table. He went on : " Mrs.
Davenport, I am afraid the worst must be
faced."

The worst ! " she cried, rising and looking
wildly at him, her voice now coming
in a terrified whisper from between her
lips, which at the moment lost their colour.
The worst ! What do you mean by the
worst ? What do you know of the
worst ? "

Her face showed intense eagerness,
mingled with intense fear.

"I am very sorry to be obliged to give
you bad news."

And it is ? " with still greater eagerness
and fear.

That Mr. Davenport will not recover.' ,

"That he is dead ? " leaning forward on
the back of her chair towards him.

Unhappily, yes."

Of his old disease ? "

She still kept her eyes on Santley's
face.

Perhaps. Did he complain to-night ? "

"Yes; he said he was too ill to think
of lying down."

He used, no doubt, to inhale chloroform
when the spasms were bad ? "

Always."

Yes, I got the smell of chloroform.
"Well, one of these spasms may have been
too severe ; and now you know the worst,.
Mrs. Davenport."

She sat down on her chair and seemed
about to faint. There was wine on the
table. Santley poured some into a glass
and made her drink it. After a w T hile
she became composed, and the look of
eagerness and dread disappeared wholly
from her face, and the red returned to
her lips.

She was the first to speak. Her voice
had regained all its old, firm serenity.
Her face was calm and commanding.
She looked, once more as though neither
the onslaught of battle nor the wreck of
worlds could disturb her.

"You, sir," she said, once more addressing
Santley, "I have to thank for your
promptness in coming at this hour to one
whom you never even heard of before.
And " — turning to Paulton — " I have to
thank you most sincerely for your kindness
in summoning the doctor for me in
my extremity."

Each man protested he had in this matter
done no more than his duty, and both said
they sympathised with her in the awful
calamity which had fallen upon her.

She bowed her head in acknowledgment
of their kind-hearted speeches, and went
on :

"I am, I may say, alone in the world

and without a friend in London. I am
now, or shall be when you go, alone in this
house. I do not know what is to be done
in a case of this kind. For a long time
I have been aware my husband might die
at any moment. But now that this has
happened, I find myself as unprepared for
it as though the possibility of his death had
never before entered my mind. I would
therefore ask you to add to the favours you
have already conferred by telling me what I
ous;ht to do in the morning:. "

She spoke in the most measured and
deliberate way. It was plain she did not
want to excite compassion. Her manner
went so far as to imply that she would resent
expressions of condolence. She seemed to
wish the two men would regard her simply
as an inexperienced woman confronted by
an unexpected difficulty, and that they
would confine themselves to the business
aspect of the affair.

Santley and Paulton looked at one another
inquiringly.

"It will be impossible for you to stay
by yourself in this house to-night," said
Paulton, who was completely subjugated by
her regal beauty, her sudden misfortune,
and her forlorn plight.

But what am I to do ? " she asked,
turning to him. " It is too late or too early
to look for ordinary help ; and if I could
get a person to come and stay with me, this
place is not fit to receive any one."

Paulton was overwhelmed by this speech
and the contemplation of the scene before
him. Here was the most superb woman he
had ever seen in his life alone in this house
of chaos by night with the dead body of her
husband, who had spoken to her but a few
hours ago. She could not live here by herself
till daylight. It would drive her mad,
or would kill her. It would be little short
of murder to leave her as she was. He

could see plainly that her present calmness
was artificial, and that when the need for
self-restraint caused by the presence of two
strangers was removed, she would breakdown
utterly, collapse — in all likelihood
die. He knew that when highly strung
natures break down at all they break down
more completely than any others. Then he
knew that his father and mother were the
most kind-hearted and neighbourly people
alive, and that if they only heard of the
hideous position in which this woman was,
they would hasten to her assistance. No
doubt the hour — it must now be past two —
was most awkward ; but if it was awkward
for the succourer, how much more awkward
for any one in need of help.

All this ran through his mind in a
moment. He resolved to act ; then he
spoke :

"Mrs. Davenport, my father and mother
live close by, only a few houses off. I am

sure they will be greatly pleased and take
it as a kindness if you will come up there
to-night. I could send down the coachman
to stay here. He is a most good-natured
and trustworthy man."

Dr. Santley gave Paulton a peculiar look,
of which the latter could make nothing.

What ! " she said. " At such an hour !
I could not think of it."

"I can assure you," persisted Paulton,
it will not cause any inconvenience. My
mother does not in the least mind getting
up. I am perfectly certain both my father
and mother would be greatly displeased
with me if I did not do everything in my
power to induce you to come."

He glanced at Santley for encouragement,
and again found the incomprehensible
expression on the doctor's face.

She seemed to hesitate. She looked
down at her soft, round arm lying on
the table.

"It is most considerate of you to make
me such an offer, and if I felt perfectly sure
your mother would not regard it as a very
inconvenient intrusion, I should be disposed
to accept it."

Believe me, Mrs. Davenport, I am not
exaggerating in the slightest degree when
I say that my mother would be displeased
with me if I omitted any argument likely
to influence you. I appeal to Dr. Santley.
He will tell you that my mother is most
sympathetic. What do you say,

doctor I "

I am sure I know of no one of kindlier
nature than Mrs. Paulton," said the
doctor.

The face of Santley was now expressionless,
the eyes of Mrs. Davenport were
fixed on him.

I will go," she said, and rose. She
walked slowly down the side of the table
until she reached the elbow of the couch.

She bent over the drooped head, kissed the
forward-leaning forehead, and then went
back to the door, and as she left the room
said : " I shall be ready immediately. I do
not like to go upstairs. I have a cloak
and bonnet in the hall. Please bring the
light here a moment."

"Will you wait until I come back?"
said Paulton to Santley, as he passed him
by carrying the lamp. " I will not be more
than half-an-hour."

I'll wait for you," said the doctor.

In a few seconds Paulton replaced the
lamp on the table, and then Mrs. Davenport
and he left the house.

As soon as the sound of their footfalls
had died away, the doctor once more
approached the recumbent figure.

I wish," he thought, " Paulton had not
been so enthusiastic in his invitation. Asa
rule, spasmodic asthma does not kill
directly. A little chloroform is not a bad

thing in spasmodic asthma ; but too much
chloroform is a bad thing, and there has
been too much here. Why, it's all over
the beard, and shirt, and waistcoat! She
looks as if she could do anything. I hope
this is not a case of foul play."

HINTS OF EARLY HISTORY.

Alfred Paulton had not said too much
of the kindliness of his father and mother.
He left Mrs. Davenport in the drawing-room
and knocked at his mothers door,
and explained to both father and mother
what had occurred, and the step he had
taken in the matter. After expressions of
surprise and horror at the tragedy at
Crescent House, both applauded his action.
Mrs. Paul ton then told him to go down to
the guest and say that she would follow
him in a few minutes.

When he got back to the drawing-room

he found the widow where he had left her.
She was sitting in an easy-chair, her elbow
resting on a table, her head on her hand.
She raised her head as he entered. Otherwise
she did not move.

"My mother is delighted you have
come," he said. "She will be here in a
few minutes. I see the fire has gone out.
I hope you do not feel the place very
cold?"

She looked at him with a stony stare.
Her brows were slightly raised, but around
her eyes the lids were strangely contracted.
The expression of the whole face was that
of one who suffered pain, but was not
giving attention to the pain. When she
spoke, her voice was dry and hard.

It is most kind of your mother to
interest and trouble herself about a perfect
stranger. I do not feel cold, thank you."

The contraction round the eyes relaxed.
A look of intelligence alarmed came into

her eyes, and she asked, in a husky
voice :

"Do you know anything of cases such
as this? I mean, do you know anything
of the law in such cases ? "

"The law!" he said, "the law! In
what way do you mean ? "

Oh," she cried, covering her face with
her hands, " it is dreadful to think of —
horrible ! Can you not tell me," she
pleaded, " if — if it will be necessary to
have an "

She paused and looked at him beseechingly.


An inquest ? "

"Yes."

Certainly not," he answered promptly.
With this beautiful woman before him it
was shocking to think of the ordeal and
details of an inquest. "Mr. Davenport
was suffering from a disease of long standing
; it had been particularly bad to-night,

and a violent paroxysm overcame him.
My friend, Dr. Santley, will make it
right, and you will be spared all pain
that can possibly be diverted from you."

"Thank yon," she said, feebly; and
she threw herself back in her chair.

Nothing further was said until Mrs.
Paulton entered the room. The young
man introduced Mrs. Davenport to his
mother; then he left to rouse the coachman
for the purpose of sitting up at
Crescent House. As soon as Paulton had
arranged this, he hastened back to Dr.
Santley.

"I came as quickly as I could, doctor.
That poor woman is in a dreadful state
of mind ; she looks to me as if she were
losing her reason."

"Hem," said the doctor, who was sitting
on a chair by the lamp on the table,
and had been reading a newspaper he
had happened to have in his pocket. He

VOL. I. D

seemed thoughtful or sleepy ; Paulton
was not a man of nice observation.

Poor thing ! " said the latter, compassionately
; " she is not only in great
grief for the loss of her husband, but
was very uneasy about the suddenness
of his death'

"No wonder," said the doctor drily.

The younger man sat down on a chair
and regarded his companion with surprise.
He had known the other for years, and
had always taken him for a simple, sympathetic
man. His tone now was one
of cynical distrust, although distrust of
what Paulton could not even guess. He
leant forward and peered into Santley's
face.

I told her to make her mind quite
easy on the score of the future. You
understand what I mean ? "

She does not want an inquest ? "

Precisely."

That is unfortunate, for I will not
certify."

What ! " cried Paulton, leaning still
farther forward, " you will not certify as
to the cause of death ? What do you
mean ? "

He shivered, and looked apprehensively
at the body reclining on the couch.

I don't know what the cause of death
was."

She said spasmodic asthma."

A disease that very, very rarely kills."

I thought that, on the contrary, it
was most fatal."

No. In a paroxysm of coughing,
something in the head or chest may give
way, but asthma itself does not kill."

An uneasy expression came into the
young man's face, and, looking straight
into the doctor's eyes, he said :

"And in this case what do you think
killed?"

D 2

It is impossible to say until after
the inquest. I found on the floor this"
he held a bottle up in his hand. " It
is a two-ounce bottle, empty ; it contained
chloroform. There is chloroform spilt allover
the beard, shirt, and waistcoat."

But perhaps the chloroform was administered
for the relief of the deadman
i

Perhaps so," said Santley, rising ; " we
shall find out all at the inquest. I'm off
to bed now. Let nothing be stirred here.
Good-night."

As Dr. Santley turned away from the
gate of Crescent House, Paulton s coachman
came up and the young man was
relieved. He walked home straight and
went to bed.

It was past four by this time, and after
the excitement of the night there was little
chance of the young man closing his eyes.
His life up to this had been barren of

adventure, and here was lie now plunged
into the middle of an affair which would
he town talk in twenty four hours. It
was quite plain to him, from Santley's
manner, that the latter did not think
the man had died a natural death, and
it was almost as plain he did not think
it was a case of accidental poisoning or
suicide. Gradually, as time went by, it
seemed to narrow itself down to one
question : Did or did not that superb

woman ? But no ; the mere question

was a hideous libel ! He wished he could
go to sleep ; but sleep would not come.
He tossed and tumbled until he felt
feverish. In the heat and hurry of events
a few hours old he had not had time for
thought ; now he had time for thought,
but he did not want to think. True,
he had no personal interest in that silent
room out of which he had stepped a little
while ago, but it haunted him, and lay

before his imagination, lighted up with
a fierce light which made every object
in it stand out with painful sharpness.

While the actions of which he had been
a spectator were going on at Crescent
House, all had been confusion, chaos.
Now every object was firmly defined by
a hard, rigid line ; every sound had a
metallic ring ; every motion went forward
with mathematical deliberateness and
precision. And over this scene of rigid
forms and circumspect movement presided
the woman, whose dark and lofty beauty
had filled him with amazed reverence.

Murder ! Could it be that murder had
been done ? There could be no doubt
Santley thought so. Murder done by
whom ? Ugh ! How he wished he had
had nothing to do with that house ; and
yet, it was a privilege even to have seen
her, to have heard her voice, to have
done her a slight service. Above all, it

was consoling to think she was now
under this roof. If a fool knew how his
thoughts were running now, that fool
sight think he was in love with this
woman. In love ! Monstrous ! He would
as soon think of falling in love with a
sunset, a melody, a poem.

Oh, if he could only sleep ! Why
should he trouble himself about this
matter ? Santley said there would be an
inquest. That would be trouble enough
for him in all conscience. He, of course,
would have to appear, although he
scarcely knew how his evidence could
be material.

It must be near six o'clock now. There
was no good in staying in bed any longer ;
he would get up and go out for a walk.
It was dawn, he felt feverish, and the
air would refresh him.

He set off at a quick pace. The breeze
was raw and cold. He felt physically

invigorated, but his mental unrest had
not abated. Do what he would he could
not banish the scene of the night from
his mind — he could not get rid of the
awful suspicion Santley's words had given
rise to. Over and over he told himself
that even the doctor had not explicitly
formulated that suspicion. Over and over
again that suspicion would intrude upon
hi thoughts.

He did not return to the house until
breakfast-time. At the suggestion of Mrs.
Paulton, Mrs. Davenport was breakfasting
in her own room, as she was tired and
shaken. Alfred had to go over the whole
story once more for his father, but he
was careful not to say a word of the
terrible hint thrown out by Santley.

The moment breakfast was over he
left home, and, without having made up
his mind as to whither he was going,
found himself in front of Santley's house

just as the doctor was stepping into
his brougham bound for his morning
visits.

I say, doctor," he said, getting up
close to the other, " what you let fall
about that unfortunate affair at Crescent
House kept me awake all night. You
really don't think there has been anything;
wrong; ? "

Santley shook his head gravely as he got
into his brougham, saying :

I don't know, Mr. Paulton ; I can't
say. But I am sorry you mixed yourself
up with the affair more than was absolutely
necessary."

This was but poor comfort to the young
man. He found it impossible to believe
any evil of that marvellous-looking woman.
If there was anything in what Santley said
it plainly pointed at her ; for were not she
and her husband the only people in the
house ?

He did not care to &o home. He could
not meet that woman while even the hint
of such a suspicion was in his head. He
did not suspect her ; but the suspicion had
been spoken to him, it was sounding in his
ears, and he could not bring himself toad

face to face with her and hear that
murmur. He told himself this was an
absurd condition of mind; but he could
not help it. What was she to him, or he
to her, that he should thus give way to
such feelings ? She was a beautiful, a
surprisingly beautiful woman to whom he
had rendered a slight service, shown a little
kindness. That was all.

He wandered aimlessly about for an hour,
and finally went into town. Dulwich was
intolerable to him. At Victoria railway
station he took a hansom and drove to
the Robin Hood Club. It was now between
eleven and twelve. The club had
not been long open, and there were only

three members in the place. One of th :
happened to be Ten . a young

Irishman, an intimate fid . : I
reputed to be clever, and km: a U
indolent. To him Paulton told .
of Crescent House, and what I. Sant
had hinted at.

Ud to this Jerry O'Brien had :. r
little close attention tc the story. He
was sniokinor in a huge easy-chair wi
eyes half shut Th that m n

had poisoned her husband roused even
him to attention, and as Paulton fa
finished his story he began I -.:

"And bo this doctor .:: yroora \
cert - to the : heath, and

thinks your goddess may have had a hand
in it : "

"eyes. Isn't it horrid

'what is york goddess life

'•'Dark and most lovely. A .

Good figure ? "
"Perfect."

Did you hear her name ? "

Yes ; Davenport."

Jerry O'Brien blew the smoke of his cigar
away with a whistle.

Is she English ? "

"No. I think Scotch."

Possibly Irish ? "

Ay, she may be Irish."

And her husband was an elderly man,
with a greyish full beard and chronic
asthma ? "

Yes. Do you know them ? "

By heavens, I do ! And I think I
know, if there has been foul play, who
cheated."

"Who? Not she?"

Not she directly, any way, but Tom
Blake, the biggest scoundrel Ireland has
turned out for years and years, and an old
lover of hers. I saw him in Piccadilly today.

He looked as if lie was meditating
murder. Poor old Davenport ! — I knew
him well. He was a simple man. She
must have told Blake of the lonely house.
Your doctor is right. There is reason for
suspicion, and I'll be at the inquest. You
will, of course ? "

Unfortunately, yes."

Then I promise you will hear an interesting
story."

Paulton shuddered.

SEEKING HELP.

Young Paulton felt anything but relieved
or cheered by Jerry O'Brien's words. He
began now to feel it would have been
wiser if he had not meddled in this affair.
It was quite true his father and mother
were the kindest couple in England ; but,
like most other middle-class elderly
people, they were careful about appearances
and preferred a smooth and easy way
of life to one of surprises and startling
situations.

And now were they — owing to his
hasty action of the night before — brought

into immediate contact with an inquest
and a story, which might turn out to bea
scandal, which might have for its core
an infamous crime. This other man, this
Blake, of whom Jerry O'Brien spoke in
such unmeasured terms, might, if he appeared
upon the stage, complicate matters
infinitely.

Besides, although he had taken elaborate
care to tell himself he was in no danger
of falling in love with Mrs. Davenport,
that did not make it desirable a former
and disreputable admirer should be in
the neighbourhood. But, after all, Jerry
O'Brien's surmises might be quite baseless.
This old admirer might have ceased
to admire — might never in all his life
have been within miles of Half Moon
Lane, the Crescent House.

At present what was he to do with
himself? There was a kind of treason
in leaving all the burden of the situation

on the shoulders of his father and mother.
He did not know anything about inquests
beyond what he had gathered now and
then from reading a summarised report
in a newspaper. If it was mean to keep
away from his father and mother, what
could he think of leaving this newly-made
widow derelict? And yet what
about this old lover? Confound the
whole thing! Now he was heartily sorry
he had bound himself up in it.

And yet when he thought of her
he charged himself with cowardice for
flinching.

Look here, O'Brien," he said at length,
"what ought I to do?"

"Do!" cried O'Brien scornfully; "why,
get out of it as fast as ever you can.
I hope you're not such a fool as to mix
yourself and your family any more up in
this miserable matter."

Alfred shook his head gravely.

"I can't retreat now. I have promised
to see her out of the trouble "

"And a pretty chance you have of
seeing her out of the trouble ! My belief
is that every hour will make matters only
worse."

"Do be reasonable and try and help
me. You know I would depend on you
more than on any other man living. I
can't go home and turn this woman out
of doors, and you ought to be able to
understand that I don't like to confess
to the old people I have been hasty or
unwise. Don't desert me, O'Brien."

The other got out of his chair with a
growl, and began pacing up and down
the smoking-room of the club. O'Brien
had private reasons of his own for wishing
to keep friendly with Alfred Paulton.
Jerry knew no pleasant house in all
London to spend a long evening in than
the Paultons', and he knew no nicer girl

VOL. I. e

in all London than Madge Paulton,
Alfred's younger sister. But these facts
were both reasons for his impatience with
his friend. He felt a firm conviction
the adventure of the night before would
have no gratifying sequel. The sight of
Tom Blake, taken in conjunction with
Paulton's story, was enough to make any
prudent man cautious. And here now
was Alfred, plunged headlong into one
of the most disagreeable experiences which
could befall a quiet-going citizen. It was
too bad, but there was no cure for the
thing. It would certainly be rather mean
of Alfred to retire from the position in
which he had voluntarily placed himself
with this woman. O'Brien could not
abandon his friend any more than his
friend could abandon this woman.

He stopped in his walk, and said,
abruptly :

"The first thing is to get a solicitor.
Do you know of one ? "

' There's Spencer, my own man, or
there's my father's."

"And a nice pair they'd make in a case
of this kind. Your father's man wouldn't
touch it with a forty-foot ladder, and
Spencer would get every one connected
with the matter locked up. No, you want
a man that's accustomed to the work.
He must be as sharp as bayonets and as
persevering. I would not attach so much
importance to this point, only that I know
Tom Blake is about. I feel you are
standing on a mine, and may be blown
sky-high any moment. I have it ! You
must get Prince — Prince, of Prince,
Prince, and Co. Young Prince is the
very man for you, and he's a good sort
too. Come on, and I'll introduce you to
him."

The two friends left the club and proceeded
at once to the office of Prince,
Prince, and Co. Here they were fortunate

E 2

LIBRARY - - rf(||1in|S

in finding the younger Prince, and at their
service.

He was a low-sized, stoutish, horsey-looking,
clean-shaven man of about thirty-five,
in very tight-fitting clothes. He bade
the two visitors be seated, and then listened
with exemplary patience to Paulton's story.
When it was finished, he crossed his legs
and reflected for a few moments.

"I see," he said — "I see. Supposing
Mrs. Davenport is willing I should appear
for her, I think all will be right. Of
course, it would be nonsense to pretend to
believe that a thing of this kind is agreeable.
It is not. Things of this kind are
awkward and painful ; but that is all. I
feel fully persuaded, beyond the inconvenience
of appearing as a witness, Mrs.
Davenport will suffer none. Your doctor
must be mad, I should say, Mr. Paulton.
You don't think he could be induced to
certify I "

I am perfectly sure he won't. I have
known him some years, and he is a man
of great determination," said Paulton.

Well, we must only try and do the
best we can. Has the deceased any
relatives — blood relatives, I mean ? "

"I don't know," said Paulton.

Yes, he has a brother, who lives in the
south of Ireland," answered O'Brien. " Mr.
Davenport was somewhat peculiar in his
thoughts and habits, but his brother is an
oddity."

"Ah, that is not fortunate. No doubt
he will want to know all about this unlucky
affair.

And now, O'Brien, it is your turn. I
want you to tell me all you know about
this other man, Blake."

"Well, Til tell you all I know about
the whole thing," said Jerry O'Brien.

"Ay, do," said the solicitor, settling
himself comfortably in his elbow chair.

The man who is dead, Louis Davenport,
was a native of the south of Ireland,
County Waterford, to be exact. His wife
is about thirty-four, and he must have
been about sixty when he died. She, too,
is Irish ; her maiden name was Butler.
She comes of a good Cork family — the
Butlers of Scrouthea. They were as poor
as church mice. Davenport was rich, and
had money, not land; and Marion Butler
was a beauty, as my friend Paulton has
told you.

"About ten years ago, when Louis
Davenport was elderly, and Marion Butler
no longer very young, he proposed to her
father for her. The father was delighted,
for Davenport promised all sorts of comfortable
things about money ; but when
the matter was spoken of to Miss Butler,
they found a difficulty had to be faced,
for Mr. Tom Blake stood in the way.

This Tom Blake is and was one of the

most hopeless scamps in Europe. He is
now about thirty-eight years of age, and
has deserved hanging for every year of his
life. He was in the army, to start with ;
he was kicked out of it. He tried the Turf
for a while, until he was kicked out of that
too. Then he turned his hand to cardsharping.
What he's doing now, I don't
know, except he may have gone in for a
little murder. He's quite capable of it,
I assure you, Wriggle — quite capable of it."

"And you say this Miss Butler had a
strong predilection for this objectionable
man ? "

"It amounted to nothing short of infatuation.
As the account of the matter
reached me, she was assured by people
who were quite disinterested that he was
a thorough scamp. They might as well
have saved their breath. She would
listen to all they had to say, and simply
shake her head."

"And how did they in the end overcome
this infatuation?"

"They never overcame it at all. They
got her to marry Davenport by appealing
to the baseness of Blake's nature. Some
friends of mine were very intimate with
the Butlers at that time, and I heard
the whole history of his abominable
conduct. He was then in great extremities
for money, and took a sum
down to leave the country and hold no
communication with her. That's the sort
of man Tom Blake is."

"But surely this woman whom he
treated so vilely cannot care for him still
cannot have any regard for such a
scurvy knave ? "

"I don't know how matters have gone
of late. I have been out of their tracks
for some time. If he has any influence
now it may rest on fear, not fascination.
I am quite sure if there is anything

wrong, lie is at the bottom of it. I have
been in London for months now, and
never saw him or heard of him. Is it a
mere coincidence that I should come
across him just as I hear this story from
Paulton ? "

"It is strange. I presume Mrs. Davenport
is childless ? "

"Yes. And as far as I know she is
now absolutely alone in the world, if you
do not count this brother-in-law, with
whom she never got on well."

"I'll go out to Dulwich with you
myself now. I think that will be the
best thing."

The three men rose and walked to
Ludgate Hill railway station.

CHAPTER V.

Single UNANSWERED.

When the three men arrived at Dulwich,
they went straight to Carlingford House,
where Mr. Paulton lived. The owner was
in. Some years ago he had retired from
business in the City, and now interested
himself in local affairs, his garden, his
horses, and reading. He was bluff, white-haired,
stout, brief of speech, straightforward,
kindly. He was not quite sixty
yet, notwithstanding his white hair.

Just as they got into the house he was
crossing the hall. He paused, and held
out his hand cordially to Jerry O'Brien.

"What lucky wind has blown you hereat
such an hour?" he cried. "You are
just too late for luncheon; but I daresay
they'll be able to find something
for you and Alfred, and "

He now became aware the third man
was a stranger, and stopped.

Young Paulton introduced the solicitor,
and then all four went into a little
library on the right hand side of the
hall. Alfred felt acutely the difficulty of
his position, and he found himself completely
at a loss to explain the situation
to his father. Then it occurred to him
to appeal to O'Brien for help.

"Jerry," said he, "tell the governor
all about it."

The old man looked apprehensively from
one to the other. There was evidently
something wrong.

"Out with it whatever it is, my lad'
said he to O'Brien, and, without further

delay, Jerry began. When lie had finished,
the old man seemed thunderstruck. It
was incredible that he should ever be
brought into contact with such people,
and such a history. He had sat down in
an easy-chair, and now he felt he had not
the strength to get out of it. He looked
blankly around at the three figures and
the bookcases and the walls, as if he were
awaiting contradiction from animate or
inanimate objects. But no one spoke, and
nothing occurred to reassure him.

At last the solicitor came forward with,
"You know, sir, we have really nothing
whatever to go on yet. Dr. Santley's dissatisfaction
and the lady's shrinking from
an inquiry, and the presence of this man
Blake in London may all point to nothing
end in nothing. I have come out hereto
clear up the whole thing, and I have no
doubt that if I might be favoured with half-an-hour's

conversation with Mrs. Davenport
all our uneasiness would disappear."

A look of hope came into Mr. Paulton's
face. He rose, and, approaching the
solicitor, said : "I wish you would see
her and bring us good news. She is
keeping her room, but I think she will
come down to the drawing-room if Mrs.
Paulton asks her. You would greatly
oblige me if you would see her. I
wouldn't be mixed up with a case of that
kind for any consideration."

"I shall be only too happy to do anything
I can in your interest, which is, I
presume, identical with that of the afflicted
lady. The first step to be taken is to
ascertain through Mrs. Paulton if Mrs.
Davenport will see me."

"I'll go immediately." Mr. Paulton
moved towards the door.

"A moment, sir. Don't you think that

if Mrs. Davenport will see me it would be
as well Mrs. Paulton said a few words of
preparation. Such as, for instance, that
in cases of this kind it was always desirable
to have advice, and to allow some one to
act instead of the principal ; as owing to
the distress attendant on loss one is little
able to look after matters of detail. If
Mrs. Paulton would be good enough she
might say that you thought I might be of
some slight use. Anything of that kind
Mrs. Paulton might say would prevent
my coming too suddenly on the widow."

Quite so. I am glad you mentioned
it. I shall do exactly as you suggest. I
shall be back as soon as I can." He
hurried out of the room.

In less than a quarter of an hour he
returned, rubbing his hands. It was plain
by his appearance that he had been successful.
Yes; Mrs. Davenport was in the
drawing-room, and would see Mr. Prince.

He went up, was introduced by Mrs.
Paulton, who then retired, leaving client
and lawyer together.

The lady had sent tip to Crescent
House for a change of clothes, and now
appeared in a plain, black dress, with
sleeves of ordinary length, and without
the orange scarf or the diamonds at her
throat or girdle. She motioned him to a
seat, and then took one herself.

What Alfred said had prepared him
for something out of the common, but for
nothing like what he now saw. He was prepared
to meet a beautiful woman in need
of his help — he found a regal woman who
might perhaps condescend to give him
orders. Her face was absolutely without
colour, save the full red lips, the dark
impenetrable eyes, and the black eyebrows.
But the modelling of the face was
superb, and the carriage of the head magnificent.
And yet he was conscious of

something that detracted from, or contradicted
the imperial grandeur of the head.
There was no splendour in the pose of the
figure. In the arms, and figure, and gait,
there was an air of patient, suppliant
dutifulness, that seemed to plead for love
and protection.

Mrs. Paulton has explained to me,"
she said, in a low, soft voice, "that it is
better I should have some one to advise
me in the present circumstances, and that
you have been good enough, Mr. Prince,
to allow me to look to you for the help I
need."

She spoke with great precision and
delicacy of tone. It was a flattery to
hear her utter one's name.

He answered in a low voice. His voice
never before seemed so harsh in his own
ears. "It is well for you to have
advice. You may rely upon my doing all
I can for you."

It was simply monstrous to associate
this woman with the idea of crime.
Attorney and man of the world though
he was, he could not be persuaded into
such a ridiculous belief. O'Brien must
be a fool. Or no, it wasn't O'Brien — it
was Paulton's doctor who had the honour
of broaching that absurdity.

"I am quite sure of that. And the
first thing I want to ask you about is,
when I shall need your advice ? — for I
know absolutely nothing about such things.
Mr. Davenport has a brother living ; I suppose
he had better be telegraphed for ? "

"Yes. He must be telegraphed for at
once."

Then I suppose the — funeral must be
arranged for immediately ? "

"Yes. Then, as you are aware, a few
legal formalities have to be gone through
before that."

"What are they?"

VOL. I. P

Have you not been told ? "

No. Pray tell me."

"Well, the sad event took place so
suddenly that a certain form has to be
observed. In this case it will be the
merest form."

Some sort of certificate has to be got,
I dare say ? "

"Well, yes; if you put it in that way."

And what must I do ? "

"You say you know nothing of such
matters as we are now talking about.
The first advice I have to give you is,
that you must repose full confidence in
me. Eemember, I am bound by a rule
of my profession to respect any confidence
you may place in me. I shall have to
ask you questions which would be impertinent
from any one but your legal
adviser. Mind, all this is merely to save
you annoyance hereafter. Will you trust
me with the history of last night ? "

"I will — as far as I may," faintly.

I have heard something of last night.
I will not trouble you with any inquiries
that I do not consider absolutely necessary.
You and Mr. Davenport arrived together
yesterday evening, and came on to your
new house close by, your furniture having
preceded you by only a few hours, so that
the house was all in disorder ? "

"Yes."

"And you came unaccompanied by any
servant ; may I ask you why was this ? "

"Mr. Davenport had peculiar notions
about never moving servants from one
house to another. He insisted on getting
new servants when we changed."

So that it was at his desire you came
unattended ? "

"Certainly. Only it was too late when
we arrived, we should have got someone
to help us."

And was Mr. Davenport in his

f 2

usual health when you reached Crescent
House ?"

"No. His asthma was worse, but not
very much worse. "When it was bad he
could not lie down. My room was the
only one in order, and he said he would
rest on the couch for the night. I left
him at about eleven, but did not go to
bed, as I was not quite easy about him,
and thought I'd come down and put some
coal on the fire later. I fell asleep in a
chair, and when I went down I found all
w r as over."

He had a large quantity of chloroform
by him ? "

"Yes; a two-ounce bottle, almost full."

"And he was in the habit of using
chloroform when the spasms were bad ? "

Yes ; but what do you mean ? You
are perplexing and terrifying me. Pray
speak plainly to me."

11 1 shall very soon be done. Remember,

I told you I should ask no question that
was not absolutely essential. Now, from
the time you and Mr. Davenport entered
that house, and until Mr. Paulton and
the doctor entered it, had any other
person access to it ? "

She grasped the edge of the table
near her. She trembled as in an ague.
Her lips grew as pallid as her brow.
She did not speak.

Eemember, anything you communicate
is privileged, and will not find its way
abroad through me. I am trying to
get the means of protecting you. Of
course you are fully at liberty to refuse
to answer me now ; but all questions
will have to be answered at the inquest."


Inquest ! " she whispered, in a voice
of abject terror. She rose to her feet
and stood swaying to and fro, one hand
still grasping the table. "Inquest! Mr.

Paulton said there would be no inquest.
There shall be no inquest."

"The bottle was found empty."

"Oh, Heaven, take away my life
from me ! "

"Was Blake in the house that night ?"

She took her hand from the table and
stood still a moment, looking upward.
Then slowly she raised both her arms
aloft, and cried :

"Hear Thou my prayer!"

She stood a while motionless. After a
moment she said, in a firm voice :

"No mercy!"

She dropped her arms to her side,
bowed slowly to him, and then with erect
head and a firm step walked out of the
room.

HER SUDDEN RESOLVE.

For some time after Mrs. Davenport
left the drawing-room, young Prince
stood motionless, with his hand resting
on the back of a chair. The scene had
taken him completely by surprise. At
the beginning of it he had made up his
mind, or rather his emotions had so
wrought upon him, he determined she
had no reprehensible connection with the
event of the night before.

He had implored her to confide in him,
and she had given him her confidence
up to a certain point. Then she not

only refused to trust him any more, but
behaved in such an extraordinary way as
to lay herself open to the gravest suspicions.
If she had at the end of their
interview fallen down in a faint, he could
have formed an opinion of the case — an
opinion which would not have been very
favourable to her, but still something
definite. But the manner of her leaving
the room seemed to throw a new light,
or rather cast a new kind of shadow on
the case.

He had better go down at once and
inform Mr. Paulton of what had occurred.


He left the drawing-room and returned
to the library. In as few words as
possible he told the owner of the house
that he feared there was no chance of
avoiding the unpleasantness of an inquest.
Mr. Paulton then asked what the lady
had said, but Prince explained he could

not divulge it. He made no comment
whatever.

The old man breathed heavily, and
looked about helplessly when the solicitor
had finished.

The two young men returned his look,
but there was no comforting assurance in
their gaze.

Alfred Paulton was now profoundly
impressed with a sense of the unpleasantness
into which he had drawn the whole
family.

I am very sorry, sir," said he, addressing
his father, "that I have been the
cause of all this worry. Of course I had
not the least idea last night that anything
of this kind was likely to arise.
If I had, I should never have acted as I
did."

"It is most unfortunate," said the
father.

"Well," broke in Jerry O'Brien, "there's

no use now in crying over spilt milk.
What we have to ask ourselves is : How
can it be best faced — eh, Prince ? Isn't
that the practical question ? "

I think so," said the solicitor. " For
my part I find myself in rather an awkward
position. Mrs. Davenport's interests
and yours, Mr. Paulton, can scarcely be
said to be any longer identical. I cannot
advise both. Besides, Mr. Paulton, you
have a solicitor of your own. My position
is uncomfortable — scarcely professional."

"My father's solicitor would be little or
no use in this case, Mr. Prince," said
Alfred. " That is the reason we came to
you."

"Mr. Prince," said the father, "pray
do not throw us over. If you do, I shall
not know where to turn. Can you not
show us any way out of this unhappy
situation ? "

Of course," said Prince, " you must

put up with the consequences of facts upto
this moment. What I suppose you to
be asking me is — How can further consequences
be avoided, or can they be
avoided at all ? "

"Precisely," said Mr. Paulton. "Can
they be avoided at all ? — and if so,
how ? "

Well, as you offered the hospitality of
your roof to Mrs. Davenport, and she has
accepted it, you can't say to her, or even
show to her, that you wish her to go "

Quite impossible," interrupted Alfred.

But might I not say — that supposing
she will see me again — a thing I doubt
very much — it would be most desirable
for her to move into town, so that she
might be near me and I near her?"

That would not be a bad plan," said
Mr. Paulton, looking at his * son and
O'Brien for confirmation. " What do you
think, boys?"

I don't see what better can be done,"
said O'Brien, answering for the two.

He answered quickly, for he was half
afraid that Alfred had not even yet made
up his mind as to the desirability of her
leaving the house.

"The great difficulty is that time is
short, and I don't think I could intrude
upon her again to-day. We had quite a
scene upstairs. Judging from the state of
agitation in which she left me, I should
imagine she will not see any one on business
during the remainder of the day."

At that moment the door of the library
opened and Mrs. Davenport stepped into
the room. She was in her walking dress.

All the men rose and stood looking at
her silently. Mr. Paulton was the first
to recover his presence of mind, and offered
her a chair.

She came over quietly to where he stood,
bowing slightly as she moved.

"I hope I do not disturb you, gentlemen,"
she said, in a gentle voice and with
a wan smile.

"Not in the least," said Mr. Paulton.
Will you not take a chair ? "

Thank you, no. I am going out."

Going out ! May not some one go for
you — one of my daughters or one of the
servants 1 "

You are very good ; but I must go
myself. I have just been explaining to
Mrs. Paulton. I have come, Mr. Paulton,
to thank you for your great kindness tome,
a complete stranger. Believe me, I
shall never forget it — never as long as I
live. If a friend in need is a friend indeed,
you have been a great friend ; for I never
wanted a friend more than I did this
morning. I have come to thank you and
to say good-bye."

Good-bye ! " he cried in astonishment.
"Why should you leave us?"

His surprise was not feigned.

"Since you were kind enough to give
me shelter, a serious difference has arisen
in my position. When I came into your
house I believed that there would be no
unusual trouble about my poor husband's
death. Now I understand in that I was
mistaken. It would be monstrous on my
part to involve you, Mr. Paulton, in anyway
in this unpleasantness, and it will be
best for me to be alone."

She spoke with perfect composure, and
Prince could scarcely believe that this
calm, collected woman, with the wan
smile and resigned air, was the one whoa
little while ago, had spoken impassioned
words of despair.

Mr. Paulton was disturbed by this
sudden and unexpected prospect of deliverance.
There could be no doubt of the
woman's sincerity. Here she was, without
a suggestion from any one, offering

to take the very step he desired. It was
necessary to say something, and kindhearted
as he was, a polite lie was a sin
utterly beneath him. He felt extremely
awkward.

Since you consider it useful to your
own interest that you should go, I will
say nothing against your leaving us."

"Allow me, Mrs. Davenport, to say
that I think it will be better for you to
be in London than here. I can then see
you at any moment without delay," joined
in Prince.

When she heard his voice she turned
to him. A shadow passed across her
face. When he ceased speaking, she
merely bowed. Turning her glance once
more on Mr. Paulton, she went on :

I have explained matters to Mrs.
Paulton, and said good-bye to her. Your
daughters are out, but your wife has
promised me to say good-bye to them

for me ; and now there remains for me to
say good-bye to only you and your son."

She held out her hand.

The host suffered a revulsion of feeling
now that he heard her say good-bye, and
saw her hold out her hand to him. It
was hard to picture this beautiful woman
alone in London, with her new woe. As
long as she was an abstraction, as long
as she was upstairs, and he regarded her
as simply the source of notoriety if not
of scandal, it was easy to wish her away
at any inconvenience to herself or cost
to him. But here she was now anticipating
his wishes, doing precisely as he
had most desired — about to launch herself
alone on the vast ocean of London
without a friend, and that, too, at the
very time when she was most in need of
friendly countenance and protection. It
was too bad — much too bad.

He took her Land, and said, with perfect
sincerity now :

"I am really sorry to say good-bye to
you — really sorry you must go. I would
like to be of any service to you I can.
Will you, as a favour, promise me, if I
can in any way assist you, you will let
me know ? "

"I will, indeed, Mr. Paulton. I am
most grateful to you, and I am sure you
would do anything you could for me ;
but" — she paused and sighed — "I am
greatly afraid no one can do much to
help me now. I must make up my
mind to bear what cannot be avoided — to
bear it bravely."

The tone in which these words were
uttered and the smile which accompanied
them were worse than any tears.

"But," said Mr. Paulton, still keeping
the hand she had given him, " do you not

VOL. I. G

think you had better wait a little, until
evening, even if no longer?"

I am greatly obliged to you. But
what is to be gained by delay ? Nothing."

"Well, but where do you propose
going ? What hotel do you intend staying
at ? "

"I know one," she answered, wearily,
as she withdrew her hand gently from
his. "It does not matter which or
where."

"But .you are not taking anything
with you ! You cannot go merely as you
are ! "

I fear I must. I cannot take anything
out of that awful house — no, never "
with a shudder. "All the things that
are now there are like my dead husband
dead to me for ever. I can get what I
need in London."

"At all events, you must not go alone.
You must allow some one to escort you.

I am certain my son would be delighted
to take you wherever you may wish to

got

would give me great pleasure," said
Alfred eagerly.

"You are both, I know, too good and
kind to mistake for ungraciousness the
refusal which I must give to your offer. I
have no alternative but to go alone."

Mrs. Davenport," said Prince, " I am
going to town at once. May I hope you
will allow me to see you as far as either
Ludgate Hill or Victoria? I am afraid
that my want of caution when speaking to
you a few minutes ago upstairs may have
betrayed me into saying or implying more
than I really should. We could talk a
little more on the way in."

With your permission, I will go by
myself. Farewell ; " and, with a bow that
included all, she left the room.

They saw her walk through the little

G 2

garden, open the gate, and reach the road.
Then they lost sight of her.

For a long while no one spoke. Mr.
Paulton broke the silence. "I'm very
sorry. " He did not say for what ; he
scarcely knew for what.

She's a wonderful woman," said Jerry
O'Brien. " I am not surprised at her not
speaking to me. She bowed to me as much
as to say she knew me. I often met her
before, but never saw her in any humour
like this. Why, in the name of all that's
mysterious, would she not allow any one
to go with her ? It could not do her any
harm for either you or Prince or Alfred to
go with her."

That struck me as most strange," said
Mr. Paulton.

"We are all friends here," said Prince.
"It doesn't seem strange to me. It seems
foolish, though. If they want her they can
catch her abroad as well as in England."

Abroad!" said Mr. Paulton, in perplexity.
" Surely sue is not going abroad
before the funeral of her husband. No
woman would think of leaving the country
before her husband is buried."

Under certain circumstances, a woman
might if an inquest was to precede the
burial."

Oh, I see."

Now, gentlemen, I think we ought to
be able to guess why she would have no
luggage, no escort. She is going to disguise
herself and fly to the Continent."

LIGHT AFTER DARKNESS.

When Mrs. Davenport left Paulton she
walked straight to Heme Hill railway station.
She asked when the next train would
start for Victoria, and having learned there
would be one in ten minutes, she took a
ticket for that terminus, and then sat down
on one of the seats on the platform.

It was cold, raw, dull, rainless February
weather, and she was lightly clad,
but she did not mind that. Her thoughts
were turned inward, and she had but <a
dimly reflected idea of things surrounding
her.

When the train steamed into the
station, she rose in a quick but mechanical
way, and took her seat in an empty
compartment. Upon arriving at Victoria,
she left the train in the same quick,
mechanical way, got into a cab, and drove
to a house in Jermyn Street. Having
engaged a bed-room and sitting-room
here, she sat down at once and wrote a
letter.

As soon as the letter was finished she
left the house, dropped the letter into the
first post-pillar, and then ascended to the
middle section of Regent Street. She
visited several shops, bought many things,
and ordered many more. When this was
done she paused, seemingly at a loss.

My letter," she thought, " will not be
there until night. In the meantime, what
shall I do ? " She walked slowly down
Regent Street. At last she started.
"How stupid," she thought, "I have

been not to telegraph ! If I had telegraphed
I could have had an answer in
an hour."

She hastened forward, asked a policeman
where the nearest telegraph office was, and
on arriving there despatched a message.
Then she went back to Jermyn Street,
and, laying aside her bonnet and mantle,
waited.

In an hour and a half a reply came. It
ran :

U I shall he with you almost as soon as
this"

When she read the message she got up
and walked about the room in a state of
great excitement. It was now dark, and
the gas had not yet been lighted in the
room. As she paced up and down she
wrung her hands and moaned. After a
while she became calmer, but still continued

walking up and down. She had
eaten nothing that day, yet she felt no
want of food. In fact, when the servant,
upon her return, suggested that she had
better order dinner, she had refused todo
so with a shudder. She knew she
should need for the coming interview all
her strength, but she could not bear the
notion of food. She had not slept during
the whole night, yet she felt no want of
sleep.

"I feel," she thought, "as though my
sorrows were immortal, and that I shall
require earthly succour no more."

She had not long to wait in solitude.
A hansom drove up to the door, a man
jumped out, and in a few minutes he was
ushered into the room. He found her
still in the dark, leaning on the mantelshelf.


Marion," , he said — " are you here,
Marion ? "

Yes," she answered, " I am here."

I cannot see yon, it is so dark."

"It is very dark. It never has been
darker in all my life, and you know it."

"Will you not shake hands with me
and order lights ? "

Neither. What is to be said can
best be said in the dark. It is in the
nature of darkness itself. Sit down. I
prefer to stand ; I wish you to sit. Sit
down."

His eyes were now becoming accustomed
to the obscurity. He found a chair, and
sat down.

"Are you alone V he asked, looking up
at where she stood, motionless, by the
mantelpiece.

Absolutely" she answered, in a cold,
hard voice. "And you know it."

How could I know it ? I got your
telegram, and came at once. Marion, you

are speaking to me in a tone I am unused
to from you."

Ay," she said, u I am unused to my
own voice in its present tone. I am
risking much for you, and you do not
deserve that I should risk anything for
you."

Marion," he cried, half-rising, " you
have not left him ? You have not resolved
to throw your fate in with mine at last ?
Marion, my darling ! Marion, let me come
to you."

Stay where you are," she said, in a
tone of perplexity, and with a shudder.
If you move from that chair, it must only
be for the door. Eemember this once for
all."

"You are very hard, Marion — very hard.
It is a long day since we met, and now
you will not even give me your hand. You
would give your hand to the most ordinary

friend you have : think of what we were
once."

His voice had a firm, manly, straightforward
ring in it, and withal an undertone
of passionate entreaty.

"I have thought too much of what
has been once. I have thought too much
of what was between you and me long
ago. I have another matter to think oi
to-night."

And what is that, Marion ? "

I have to think of last night."

He uttered a cry of surprise and half
rose from his chair.

"Did you know I was there? I thought
you were asleep. He said you were. Did
he tell you I was there?"

She paused a moment and made a
powerful effort to control herself. When
she spoke, her voice was unsteady, and
showed that a violent conflict was going
on in her breast.

He told me nothing," she said. " I
have sent for you in order that you
may tell me all. Now go on. All,
remember."

"All?" he asked. "I would rather
not tell you all. I never told you a
lie yet."

"All," she said— "all, or go."

He shifted uneasily for a few minutes
on his chair, and then spoke :

"Well, Marion, since you will have it
all, you shall. I am no better than ever
I was. I leave it to you to say if I
could, being only human, be much worse.
You might have made a different man
of me once. You wouldn't. Let that
pass."

"Yes, let that pass, and let it pass
quickly. I did not sell you for a sum
of money."

Her voice was scornful.

"No, you did not. You did better*

You sold yourself for a sum of money.
Shall we cry truce?"

"Yes; go on*'

I've been a good deal on the Continent.
I've been doing a great many
things I should not do. Amongst others,
I have been gambling ; and, worst of all,
I have lost. There are many excuses fora
man gambling. There is no excuse fora
man losing. Well, I got cleaned out,
and I came home — I mean I went back
to Ireland.

"Naturally I faced south. Naturally I
went on to Waterford. Naturally I found
myself in Kilcash."

She made a gesture of dissent. But it
was too dark for him to see. She said :
"Most unwise and most unnatural."

"It may have been unwise, but it was
most natural. What can be more natural
than that a man should go where his

heart But if I say any more in

this strain, you will be angry ? "

"Most assuredly,"

Well, when I got to Kilcash, I kept
my ears open, and soon I heard that
you were about to leave Kilcash House
and take a house in or near London. I
inquired still further, found out the day
you were to leave, and got the address
of the house you had taken. I came onto
London.

"I arrived here the night before last.
I knew you could not be in your new
house until late in the day. I wanted
to call most particularly. There was
not an hour to be lost. It was neck or
nothing with me. I resolved to call at
Crescent House that very night, and
I did."

"You did?" she said, in a voice like a
terrified echo.

"You knew I was there. He told
you ? "

"No; go on. Go on, I say. You did
not ask for me ? "

"No. I wanted to see him."

It was close to eleven, or after it
then ? "

"After it."

And you wanted to see him at such
an hour, and you knew he was an invalid ? "
she said, scornfully.

I was an invalid myself."

You ! What was the matter with
you ? " — again that tone of scorn.

"A worse disease than his — poverty."

What ! " she cried, leaving the mantelpiece,
and going a step towards him in the
dark. " I thought you got the price of
your — of me before."

Marion, you are unjust — cruelly unjust.
When I called on your husband last night,
it was not to beg or to try and get money

from him, because of anything in which you
or I ever took part. I had a claim with
which you have no connection, and the
nature of which I will not divulge to you.
He may if he likes."

"He never will," she said, with something
between a laugh and a sob.

11 So be it. It may be all the better the
matter should never be spoken of. But
to proceed. I knocked and he let me in.
He explained that you were gone to bed,
and that he and you were alone in the
house. He was very polite, for he had an
idea of why I came — or rather of the card
of introduction, so to speak, that I brought
with me. He made me take a chair, told
me he was not well enough to lie down, ashe
had one of his bad attacks of asthma,,
though by no means a very bad one, and
we had a pleasant general conversation for
half-an-hour or so."

"Pleasant conversation ! " she cried, fall-vol.

I. II

ing back to her old position at the chimney-piece.


"Yes, I assure you it was quite a pleasant
conversation. He told me all the
incidents of your journey over from Ireland,
and I amused him with my experiences
on the Continent."

"This is too ghastly," she said. "Do
not tell me any more about it. Did he
give you — what you came for ? "

Oh, yes, or part of it."

And then ? " she asked, in a hard, constrained
voice.

"And then after a few more words I
stood up and said good-bye, left the house,
and came back to town."

Wait," she said. " I will give you
another chance. Sit where you are. I
shall be back in a few minutes."

In the dark ? " he asked.

Yes. Is there anything in the dark
that frightens you ? "

11 No," he answered ; "but it is stupid to
sit in the dark alone."

Perhaps when I am gone you may not
be quite alone. You may have memories
for company."

There was great meaning in her voice.

He said merely " Perhaps," and she was
gone.

While she was away he sat perfectly
still. There was little or no light from
the dull low fire, and as the blinds were
down and curtains drawn, none reached
the room from the street.

In a few minutes he heard the door
open and some one enter. She came to her
old position by the chimney-piece and said :

Now, if you can find a match, you may
light the gas."

He had wax cigar-lights in his pocket.
He struck one, and in a moment the gas
flared up. He looked at her, and cried,
starting back :

h 2

Merciful heavens, Marion, what masquerade
is this ! "

"No masquerade' she said calmly,
scrutinizing him. " These are my widow's
weeds come from the mourning warehouse
a few minutes ago. They say you
ought to be prepared to see me in
them."

I — I ! — prepared to see you in widow's
weeds ! Is Davenport dead ? "

Women whose husbands are living do
not wear such things as these. They say
you ought to be prepared to see me dressed
as I am now."

She touched the streamers of her cap and
pointed to the crape of her dress.

"What do you mean by saying they say
I ought to be prepared for this ? Who are
they f — and what do you mean ? "

"As I left the room a moment ago,
a servant brought me this note. Read
it"

I

LIGHT AFTER DARKNESS. 101

He took the note and read it first
quickly, a second time slowly. Then,
letting it fall from his grasp, he threw
his hands above his head, and crying out,
Oh, God ! " fell back on a chair.

mr. Davenport's account of the matter.

Shortly after Mrs. Davenport left Car-langford
House, Half Moon Lane, that
afternoon, a supplementary luncheon was
announced, and the four men went into
the dining-room.

Mr. Paulton had already lunched with
the family, but he wished to be with the
others ; so he sat down at the table with
them, and broke a biscuit and half-filled
a glass with sherry. Jerry O'Brien and
Prince were in no humour for trifling
with food ; they were both downright
hungry. Alfred ate mechanically, and was.

much pre-occupied. The talk, therefore,
for a quarter of an hour, was slight, fragmentary,
as though by some agreement :
no one referred to what had just occurred
in the library, or to anything else
connected with Crescent House. Young
Prince felt that although there must be
and are extremely interesting tragedies in
the world, luncheon, when one is hungry,
was a matter not to be neglected. He had
more than once in a criminal court eaten
sandwiches and drunk sherry in the interval
for luncheon, with the moral certainty that
his client, who had been temporarily removed
from the dock, would be sentenced
to death before the Court rose, and hanged
before that day four weeks,

Here were a cold rabbit pie, cold ham,
and excellent sherry, well-baked, fine white
bread, and nicknames, and no particular
reason for hurry — no fear of hearing
Silence " called out while one was but

half-finished. The day was dull, but there
was an ample fire burning brightly in the
grate, the chair was soft and well-designed,
so why should he bother himself for another
quarter of an hour ?

It was very easy for him to hold his
tongue and to assure himself that he need
not bother himself just now about Mrs.
Davenport and her unpleasant predicament ;
but her predicament would not be banished,
and every now and then some incident of
either the drawing-room or library interview
would rush into his mind with all
the unexpected suddenness of that unwelcome
cry of " Silence ! " in the middle
of luncheon at a criminal trial.

Upon the whole, that luncheon was not
as calm or as successful as young Prince
meant it to be. He had never seen anyone
at all like Mrs. Davenport before, and
he could make little or nothing of her.
He now began to think that he had talked

"flippantly when he said she was certainly
about to leave the country. Reviewing all
he had seen and heard, he came to the
conclusion that the safest thing for him
to assume at present was — nothing. At
length he spoke, addressing Alfred and
Jerry O'Brien :

"Although Mrs. Davenport did not say
anything to the effect when leaving, I
suppose I had better act for her — until I
hear something to the contrary."

Jerry O'Brien glanced at Alfred, and saw
what he wished to say, but held back from
speaking, because of the trouble his hasty
action of the night before had brought
about. Therefore Jerry made himself
spokesman for his friend.

Of course, Prince, you go on acting
for her, on her behalf. She has left this
house finally now, and is not likely to cause
any new unpleasantness here. Whether
Mrs. Davenport is to blame or not, she

can't be left alone and unaided in such a
strait as this. What do you say, Mr.
Paulton ? "

I am quite of your opinion, O'Brien.
Now that she is out of the house I would
be disposed to do anything I could for her.
It's different now from what it was an
hour ago. Go on, Mr. Prince ; and I
most sincerely hope she may come out
of the inquiry without the shadow of
blame."

I sincerely hope so," said Prince,
rising. Luncheon was over by this time.
Now, the first thing I should like, is
to have a look at the place — at this Crescent
House, as you call it."

Alfred and O'Brien got up, and in a
few minutes the three found themselves
in the hall of that house. The police were
already there.

Prince told the officers who he was and
then proceeded to make inquiries. The-following

was the state of affairs at that
time :

The inspector had been there about an
hour. He had made an elaborate, but
not exhaustive search in the room. The
body was in the position it had been found
in. An empty two-ounce bottle had been
discovered on the floor. This was the
bottle. It was labelled chloroform, smelt
of chloroform, and had no cork in it. A
cork which fitted it, and which also smelt,
although faintly, of chloroform, had been
found on the table close by the body.

In the pockets of the deceased had been
discovered a number of letters, a small sum
of money, and a pocket-book. This was
the pocket-book. It was thin, and covered
with Russia leather; it was old, and had
been but little used. It contained several
addresses, and on the first leaf was written
a date of eleven years ago. It was more-than
likely this date corresponded with

that on which the book became the property
of deceased.

Most of the memoranda in that book
could have no bearing on the present case,
as most of them had evidently been made
long ago. The last entry but one was
dated in what was believed to be the handwriting
of the deceased. It was made more
than two years ago. After this last entry
but one, a leaf was missing. A leaf had
evidently been torn out — and clumsily torn
out, too — for a jagged portion of the leaf
remained behind.

Then came the last entry of aM. This
was also apparently in the handwriting of
deceased. The writing was in pencil, and
very shaky, and for a long time could not
be deciphered. It was headed " Crescent
House." The domicile fixed the date, for
the night before was the only occasion on
which Mr. Davenport crossed the threshold
of that house. He had not even seen the

house before renting it, but took it on the
representation of an agent. The words on
this page were :

"Pretended death. Blake gone. He
emptied chloroform on me — held me down.
Can't stir. Dying."

After reading this the three men stood
aghast for a while. They looked at one
another. They looked at the inspector.
The inspector shook his head.

There's hangman's work here," he said ;
and he was about to turn away, when a
sudden thought struck Prince. He said
to the inspector :

I beg your pardon. Does that pocketbook
contain any London address of Mr.
Davenport ? "

I don't know," said the inspector ;
and I am afraid I have already shown
you too much."

"I'd be very much obliged to you if
you'd see. I represent Mrs. Davenport in
this matter, and at the moment I don't
know where to find her. She omitted to
give me her address when she left me
this afternoon. I want to write to her,
and if you find any London address of Mr.
Davenport, I'll chance directing my letter
there. That can do no harm to any one.' 7

The inspector hesitated, but at length
opened the pocket-book, and after a search,
said :

There's an address here at Jermyn
Street ; but it's six years old."

Never mind," said Prince ; " I'll risk
it. What is it?"

The inspector read it out, and Prince
took it down.

Prince, Alfred Paulton, and Jerry
O'Brien were about to leave the room,
when the first turned to the inspector,
and said :

By the way, you did not find the page
that has been torn out of the pocketbook
? "

"No," said the inspector, nodding his
head significantly ; " but there's evidence
enough on what we did find to hang a
score of men."

The three then walked to Heme Hill
railway station, and took tickets for
Ludgate. At the latter place Prince
left the two friends and went back to
his office.

Here he sat down and wrote the
following letter :

Lincoln's Inn Fields, E.C.
"Feb. — , 18—.

'Dear Madam,

"By accident I got this address,
and will chance writing you here in the
hope this note may reach you.

I have been to Crescent House. A

pocket-book of the late Mr. Davenport
has been found. It contains the following
entry in the handwriting of deceased :
'Pretended death. Blake gone. He
emptied the chloroform on me — held me
down. Can't stir. Dying

"Awaiting your further instructions,
"I am, dear Madam,

Yours faithfully,

Echard PRINGLE."

This was the note which Mrs. Davenport
handed Thomas Blake as she stood over
him in her fresh widow's weeds the night
after her husband's death.

"WHICH of us is mad?"

The morning after the interview between
Mrs. Davenport and Tom Blake in Jermyn
Street, there were paragraphs about Mr.
Davenport's death in the daily papers.
These paragraphs were almost colourless,
and barely suggested any cause for uneasiness.
They all wound up by saying
that the inquest would be held next
day.

That afternoon Richard Prince calledon
chance at the house in Jermyn Street,
and found Mrs. Davenport at home.
She received him in a dreamy, half-vol

I I

conscious way, and answered listlessly
the common-place questions he put to
her. Before seeing her he had made up
his mind not to refer to the scene which
had taken place between them yesterday.
He was firmly convinced she would not
give him her full confidence, and that
to seek to get at the bottom of the
affair would be only to court obstruction.
From her manner he assumed she wished
nothing to be said of what had taken place
in the Paultons' drawing-room at Dulwich.
He began by trying to prepare her for
the inquest. She shuddered slightly when
he used that word, and yet seemed but indifferently
alive to the importance of the
situation. She answered in monosyllables,
and contented herself mostly with merely
bowing her head in token that she attended
to what he said.

No material advantage could be gained
by speaking of the former interview

between them. He had drawn his own
conclusions from it, and it was abundantly
clear to him she wished that interview
ignored. Now that he was once more
under the spell of her presence, he felt
his interest in her case rekindle, and
the charm of her beauty reasserting
itself.

One thing, however, must be spoken
of. It was absolutely necessary he should
say something of the note he had written
her last evening. He waited for a pause,
or rather caused a pause in the conversation,
for she volunteered nothing.

"Having found this Jermyn Street
address in the pocket - book of Mr.
Davenport, I sent a few lines to
you yesterday evening in the hope
they might reach you. Did you get
them ? "

This question seemed to arouse her

attention. She clasped her hands in her

i 2

lap, and, turning her face fully towards
him, answered :

Yes ; I got your note and the extract
from the pocket-book also."

She seemed perfectly cool and collected.

It would be well if you would tell
me anything you know about that entry
on the leaf of the pocket-book. It hasa
terrible significance in the case."

Her calmness now astonished him. He
had the evening before been prepared for
an explosion. He had expected to find
her completely broken down, or in a state
of high nervous excitement to-day. Upto
this she had been listless ; now she
was attentive and mute. Her face looked
paler than yesterday, but he could not
say whether this was owing to its own
loss of colour or to the effect of the
white cap or the crape round her throat.
He waited a moment with a view to

giving weight to his next question. It
was :

With regard to the memorandum made
by Mr. Davenport, is there anything you
would like to say to me ? In the face
of that memorandum, you of course know
that Mr. Blake's presence will be essential
at the— inquiry."

I suppose so," she said, unmoved.
She replied to the latter part of his
speech first. " With regard to the entry
in his pocket-book, it is right you should
know that my late husband was at one
time subject to hallucinations, delusions."

And you think this writing of his
may have been the result of a delusion
or hallucination ? "

It is quite possible ; I can explain it
in no other way."

"Oh, this is a great relief! I did not
know he was subject to hallucinations.

This is a most important fact. "What
was the nature of the delusion under
which he suffered ? "

Up to this point Prince had felt in
despair. Now his interest and courage
rose.

He fancied people had formed a conspiracy
against him, and that their design
was to rob him first and then murder him."

Her enunciation was particularly distinct,
her face impassible.

This is most vital," he said. " Indeed
it may explain much that now sorely needs
explanation. You no doubt often had the
opportunity of seeing him labouring under
these ailments ?"

No — never. He has not had an attack
since we were married."

"Well, we must only do the best we
can. Do you know if there is anything
like insanity in his family ? "

Prince felt no little disappointment that

she could not personally testify to the
disease ; but he was resolved to make the
most of it.

I am not aware that there is anything
which could be called insanity in the
family. His brother is decidedly odd, and
Mr. Davenport was odd at times. For
instance, as I told you, he would never
bring old servants into a new house.
There were other little traits — some
theories he had about betting on horses,
and which I do not understand, but which
I have been told were at least fanciful."

Prince's curiosity was aroused. Outside
his profession the thing in which he took
most interest was horse-racing.

I am not sure that it can be of any
consequence ; but if you could remember
it, I should like to know what that
peculiarity in betting was."

I am not quite sure," she said ; " but
I have an indistinct recollection he made

it a rule never to bet on any horse the
name of which began with a letter lower
down in the alphabet than ' N.' '

Ah ! " said the young solicitor, in a
tone of surprise and reflection. He
resolved to look this matter up when he
got back to the office. He was still
curious. "And may I ask if you know
whether he found the system a good one ?
If he found it to fail oftener than to
succeed, and still kept to it, one might
put the persistency down to mental
obliquity."

Although he said this in a confident tone,
the words were no sooner uttered than
he began to doubt their justice, for he had
known many men who adhered to a system
which had nine times out of ten betrayed
them.

I cannot tell you. I do not know'

"If he betted heavily, you would have
been likely to hear whether he won or

lost. Of course when I say heavily, I
don't mean that he ran any danger of
crippling himself. But he must have been
elated when he won and dejected when
he lost?"

Xo. He did not bet heavily. He
never seemed to care whether he won or
lost. It was the system which he prized,
and not the wager."

Young Prince thought this was a sure
sign of a disordered mind ; but he kept
the opinion to himself, as he considered it
more a matter of private than professional
interest. He said :

I suppose Mr. Davenport could not
have been in financial embarrassment
owing to any betting transactions ? "

I am certain he was not."

"Or from any other cause?"

I am sure he was not."

This may be of the greatest value. I
beg of you to believe I am asking this.

question solely with a view to your
interest."

He paused and looked earnestly at her
for permission to go on.

She bowed.

"Have you any reason to think that
the unfortunate event which has occurred
might have been brought about by his
own act ? "

She moved her hands nervously in her
lap.

"I am not sure that I understand you."

There is nothing in your mind which
could lead you to suppose he has committed
suicide ? "

She shuddered visibly and answered ina
constrained whisper :

"Nothing — nothing whatever."

Well, Mrs. Davenport, it will be absolutely
necessary for us, in the face of the
memorandum made on the leaf of his
pocket - book, to have some theory of

what took place. Can you suggest any
theory ?"

He spoke gravely, impressively. His
personal interest in her was again growing
stronger than his professional interest
in what he now regarded as her defence.
He swore to himself that he would use not
only all his skill as an advocate, but all
his faculties as a man to extricate this
beautiful woman from the horrible position
in which he found her, and to assuage
as much as might be the pains she would
have to endure. Under the overwhelming
spell of her rich comeliness, and in front
of the evidence afforded by her presence
here this afternoon, he reproached himself
bitterly for the suspicion he had uttered
the day before as to her fleeing from the
country. It was brutal of him to think
of such a thing then, and still more brutal
•of him to speak his thoughts.

She did not reply to his last question at

once. She looked at him steadily, without
flinching, but remained silent.

He spoke again, this time earnestly,
almost passionately :

Mrs. Davenport, if you give me any
theory to go on, I promise you, upon my
word of honour as a man, to make the
most I can of it. I'll leave no stone unturned
to put things in their best light.
I'll work without ceasing ; I'll do nothing
else, think of nothing else until I see you
through this ordeal. I will not ask you
again for any confidence you wish to
withhold from me. But if out of justice
to yourself you will not, out of justice tome
you must give me something to go on.
You must give me at least a theory."

He spoke to her eagerly, fiercely, and
held out his hands towards her in supplication.


She dropped her eyes a moment as if

to collect her thoughts, and then looking
straight into his face once more, said with a
slight tremor in her voice :

I have a theory ; but I am afraid
it is not one that will meet with your
approval."

"If it is the best you can give me,
trust me to do the best that can be done
with it. But, for heaven's sake, give me
the best one you can. Give me a chance.
All I want is a chance to show you my
devotion — to your interests."

He felt he was being carried away by
the irresistible magic of her eyes. He
paused after the w T ord " devotion," and
spoke the final phrase of his speech in a
less fervent tone, to modify by matter and
manner what had gone before.

There is," she said, unclasping and
then clasping her hands again, " but one
theory possible in the case. As I told

you a moment ago, Mr. Davenport was
at one period of his life subject to delusions
"

Pardon me," interrupted Prince ; "you
said awhile ago that you had no experience
of your own as to this infirmity. I assume
we shall be able to produce evidence to
prove that ? "

Undoubtedly there will be evidence."

"May I ask from whom we are to expect
this evidence ? Mr. Davenport's brother ?
He knows all about it, I suppose ? "

No, not Mr. Davenport's brother. I
am not sure that Mr. Edward Davenport
ever knew anything about it."

That is unfortunate, since, so far as
I understand, Mr. Edward Davenport is
the late Mr. Davenport's only surviving
relative."

"He is. But at the time when Mr.
Davenport had those seizures he was.
abroad, on the Continent. For many years

of his life Mr. Davenport did not live in
the United Kingdoms. When I first knew
him he had just come home after travelling
for a long time in America and Europe.
Although I am not quite sure, I think upto
a very short time before I met him
he had been out of the country most of
his life. He was not very communicative
about the past, or indeed on any subject.
It was while he was staying for a time
in Florence he had these attacks of
hallucination — "

And the evidence we can command is
that of an eye-witness ? " broke in Prince.

Certainly."

The inquest will be tomorrow. May
I not have the name of the witness ?
There is no time to be lost. In fact, this
evidence, this extremely important evidence,
comes very late. I am sorry I did
not hear of it before. But we must do
the best we can with it." >

He spoke in a voice of deep concern.

There was a reason why you did not
hear of this evidence earlier. You asked
me to give you my theory, Had I not
better do so before going into other
matters ? "

She raised her clasped hands slightly
from her lap in faint protest.

"I beg your pardon for interrupting
you. By all means let me have the theory
first. My anxiety betrayed me into asking
questions which ought to have been
deferred."

He was filled with admiration of this
woman who could keep so closely to the
point, and with shame for himself for his
unthrifty straying from .it.

"As you are no doubt aware, chloroform
affects different people in different ways.
A little of it will kill some people ; a large
quantity will scarcely affect others. Many
under its influence become delirious nd



rave. At certain periods, while under the
power of chloroform, one may be relieved
of pain, conscious of surrounding things,
capable of moving, and yet delirious. The
theory I would suggest is that Mr. Davenport
inhaled some chloroform to ease a
spasm of asthma, that he became delirious,
that he had a return of his old hallucination,
then wrote what was found on the
leaf torn from the book, and while endeavouring
to administer a second dose to
himself, spilled the contents of the bottle
over his beard and chest."

Her words came in as calm and measured
a way as though she were speaking on an
abstract subject to an indifferent audience.

As she went on, Prince's admiration
gave way to amazement. A scientific witness
could not be more unmoved. Was
it possible this superb woman opposite him
had been explaining to him in these cold,
measured accents her way of accounting for

VOL. I. K

the death of a husband who had been alive
and without any immediate danger of death
a couple of days ago, and who had since
died a death which was, to say the least
of it, provocative of inquiry ?

He leaned back in his chair, sighed
thoughtfully, and knit his brows. He
cleared his throat once or twice to speak,
but remained silent. He felt dull and
heavy, as though something oppressed his
chest.

That is my theory — the only possible
theory," she said, leaning forward and
looking quietly into his face, without any
change in the expression of her own.

He shook himself slightly, looked perplexed,
not satisfied. At last he spoke :

And what evidence have we in support
of this supposition ? "

She leaned back in her chair and whispered,
"None."

He started, sat up, and looked at her

keenly. He drew down his brows over his
eyes as though the light hurt him.

"I am afraid," said he, "such a theory
would not stand without most substantial
testimony. No jury would give a satisfactory
verdict on a mere statement such
as that, for, you see, there are the last
words written by the deceased. 5 ' Until
this moment he had not used that cold,
formless word " deceased" to her. But
he felt now that he was regarding the
matter in a purely professional way, and
that so was she. In a moment he continued,
laying impressively significant
emphasis on his words : " How are we
to explain the fact of Mr. Blake's name
appearing on that piece of paper ? "

"Mr. Blake," she said, half-closing
her eyes as though she was weary, " was
the last person he saw before his death,
and, when the delirium came upon him,
he naturally introduced the name of Mr

k 2

Blake as being that of the person most
immediate to his memory."

What ! " cried Prince, starting up
off his chair and leaning towards her,
"Do we admit he was there ? "

He could scarcely contain himself for
astonishment. He looked at her as
though he expected to find her transformed
into the person of Blake himself.


"Undoubtedly," she said, opening her
eyes slowly and looking up at him.
Mr. Blake was there a little while before
Mr. Davenport died."

Prince groaned, ran his fingers excitedly
through his hair, and began pacing
the room up and down hastily.

After a dozen turns, he stopped in front
of her chair.

"When did you learn that your late
husband had had hallucinations ? "

"Last night."

"Last night only! Who told you?"

"Mr. Blake."

Mr. Blake !— Mr. Blake ! And who saw
your husband when he was suffering from
these hallucinations ? "

"Mr. Blake."

"And is he the witness we have as to
the hallucinations ? "

"Yes."

Merciful heavens ! Which of us is
mad? Where did you meet this Blake?"

"I wrote to him to come here, and he
came."

You ivrote him to come here ! Heaven
help you — heaven help you ! It is you who
are mad."

And he hastened out of the room.

THE ELDER Single SPEAKS.

"When Richard Prince reached the street,
he set off at a rapid walk for Lincoln's
Inn Fields. His thoughts and feelings
were too much disturbed for reasoning.
The dialogue of the past hour hurried
through his brain in an incoherent, inconsequential
mass. In the intense excitement
of the last few minutes, he
had told her she was mad, and he
almost believed it. He had known from
the previous day that Blake had been
at Crescent House on the night of
Mr. Davenport's death. He had most

plainly, most impressively given . her to
understand that he knew it. She must
have seen plainly then he attached most
disastrous importance to that visit of her
former lover. Since then the leaf torn
out of the pocket-book had been discovered.
On that leaf appeared a deliberate
accusation of murder in the handwriting
of the dead man against Blake. That,
in all reason, was sufficiently serious ;
but worse followed. She had the day
after her husband's death asked this
man Blake to visit her !

From Blake she had, Prince felt not
the least doubt, adopted that elaborate
and childish theory of the fatal event.
Blake had told her in that interview a
thing neither she nor his brother had

o

ever known before — namely, that the
deceased man had at one time, and
to Blake's personal knowledge, suffered
from mental aberration of a kind which

would exactly explain away that damnatory
writing on the paper — if any one
could believe Blake's story ! The whole
affair was simply monstrous. If he viewed
the matter from a purely professional point
of view, he would have been heartily sorry
he ever connected himself with it. But he
could not regard the case solely as a matter
between client and solicitor. He was under
the spell of this woman, and he could not,
if he would, and he would not if he could,
escape. Only one thing was clear to his
mind now, and that took the form of
muttered words :

There will be business for the hangman
in this affaire''

When he arrived at the office lie found
his father in, and having locked the door
of the private room, he communicated to
the old man the substance of the interview
which had just been brought 'to a
close.

His father listened to the recital with
the most circumstantial patience. When
the son had finished his tale, and wound
up with the opinion that some one was
going to swing for the matter, the father,
to the son's unspeakable astonishment,,
looked up cheerfully, and said :

"lam not at all sure of that, Dick — not
at all."

Bless my soul, father, where do you
see the way out of it ? "

I can't say," said the elder man, " that
I see my way out of it; but I am sure
they do. Just run over the facts briefly :
This woman was formerly in love with
Blake ; Blake is bought off by old Davenport,
and Davenport marries the beauty.
After years, the married couple come to
London, and put up by themselves in a
detached house. That night the old lover
visits the house, and shortly after he leaves,
the wife raises an alarm, and the husband

is found dead. The doctor called in is
not fully satisfied, and hints that the man
has been killed by chloroform — a drug
frequently used by deceased. The widow
finds shelter in a neighbour's house. While
there, she is given to understand by her
attorney that it is supposed her old lover
was in the house within a short time of
the death, and that death is believed to
have arisen from chloroform, not asthma.
Upon this she displays great emotion, and
declines to give any further information.
She leaves the neighbour's house that
afternoon, and goes to a house in which
she stayed about six years ago when in
London with her husband. From that
house she sends for her old lover, and
has an interview with him. Meantime a
document is found in the handwriting of
deceased, saying her old lover has poisoned
him (deceased). Her solicitor sends a
copy of this document to her. Next day

solicitor calls upon her, and finds her quite
calm. She explains her theory of her husband's
death, and attributes the document
mentioned to hallucination, from which she
alleges deceased suffered earlier in life, and
that death was the result of accidentally
spilling the chloroform by deceased. That's
the case, as far as I can make it out. Am
I right, Dick ? "

"Yes, sir — quite right."

At the first glance it's a strong case."

"Did you ever, short of eye-witnesses,
see a stronger ? "

I've seen a lot of cases in my time —
a lot of cases. Wait a bit, Dick, until we
have another look at it. A motive lies on
the very surface ; nothing could be plainer
than the motive implied by the case. It
is : the old lover poisons the husband in
order that the woman may be free to marry
him. A money motive may turn up later
on ; if we may find that the widow is

rich. Dick, I am getting to be an old man
now, and I give you one piece of advice ,
lest I may forget it : Always suspect a.
case where the motive is glaringly obvious.
Now, the two survivors in this affair are
people of good education, good position
and intelligence, are they not ? "

Most assuredly, sir."

Neither of the two is an idiot ? "

I am greatly afraid, father, that the
lady's reason is affected."

'Observe, Dick, I did not ask you
whether both are sane or mad. But is
either of them an idiot — a drivelling
idiot — whom you would not leave alone
in a room where there was a fire or a
razor ? "

No, no ! They are both, as far as I
know — I never saw him — rational on the
surface, anyway. But I fear the strain
has been too much for Mrs. Davenport."

"Never mind about that. She may for

my purpose be as mad as she likes, so long
as she is not a drivelling idiot. Now,
supposing either of them had committed
the crime of murder in this case, do you
suppose that until drivelling idiocy had
been fully established in one or the other,
either of them would behave in such a
childish way as you describe ? Why, it
would shame any Bedlamite in Europe for
rank silliness ! The man who tried to
cool a red-hot poker in a barrel of
gunpowder would be only a little rash
compared with either of these two, if, as
you seem to suppose, either is responsible
for the dead man's death."

The younger man's face brightened.

Then you think, sir, there is still good
reason to hope ? "

I am sure there is no reason to do anything
else. This Mrs. Davenport, at your
first interview, trusts you fully up to a

certain point, and then suddenly refuses
to give you any more confidence. At your
second interview she gives you all, and
more than all, the confidence you require.
What has wrought that change ? She has
seen the old lover. She is acting upon
his advice. She has given you a great
deal of confidence, but she has not told
you everything. She is keeping back the
most important piece of all."

What is that ? "

"The line of his and her defence. He
will, of course, be professionally represented
at the inquest. There will be some one therefor
him, anyhow. I am firmly convinced
he has an unanswerable and startling
defence. If I were you I should take
every precaution I could for the protection
of my client ; but I feel fully assured he
will clear up the whole case. Now runaway.
I've got in another batch of those

MilliDoton deeds, and I want to get
through them by dinner-time. Will you
be home to dinner ? "

I don't think so, sir. I'll run out
to Dulwich and see if there is anything
new.

When young Prince found himself at
Dulwich he went to Carlingford House ;
for he knew that the folk there, especially
Alfred, would be anxious to hear the
news, and this analysis of the case by his
father had put him in good heart.

The day was fine and mild for the
season. As he entered the garden of
Carlingford House, he saw, through a
tall wicket gateway, two elderly men
walking in the grounds at the rear. One
of these he recognised as Mr. Paulton ;
the other was a stranger to him.

He passed through the wicket gateway
into the back garden. Just as he did so
the two men faced fully round, and Mr.

Paulton cried out, as lie hastened towards
the solicitor :

Mr. Prince, you are the very man
we want. We were this minute talking of
you. Mr. Davenport, this is Mr. Prince,
who has kindly consented, at our request,
to act in this unhappy affair as solicitor
for Mrs. Davenport."

Sir," said the dead man's brother,
bowing low, " I am very glad to make
your acquaintance. I hope you find
yourself in the enjoyment of good
health."

"I am quite well, thank you," said
Prince, somewhat taken aback by the
old-fashioned formality of the other.

The man who stood in front of him
was a square-made, thick-set, low sized
man of close on sixty years of age. His
hair was black and long and lank, profusely
oiled, and hung down on the collar
of his coat and shoulders. He did not

wear beard, whiskers, or moustaches. His
complexion was a lifeless sallow; his skin
wrinkled, his nose aquiline, and narrow at
the top ; his mouth weak and uncertain,
with thin, bloodless lips ; his gait half-mincing,
half-pompous ; his voice half-suave,
half raucous. His eyes were large
and prominent, and of a filmy, hazel colour.
As Prince looked at the new-comer, he
thought : " If he weren't so broad, he'd
look like a dyspeptic mummy'

I have just finished telling Mr,
Davenport all I heard about this sad
affair, and I suppose you, Mr. Prince,
can now add something to where I left
off? Mr. Davenport is most anxious to
know everything."

Young Prince had then for the second
time to go over the main features of what
had taken place since he was at Dulwich
last. Of course he was much more
reticent than he had been with his father,

VOL. I. L

and repeated nothing of what had passed
between Mrs. Davenport and himself. It
was Jerry O'Brien who had first introduced
Blake's name into the case. Mr.
Paulton had told Mr. Davenport all he
knew, without adopting the precaution of
finding out how the brother of the deadman
felt towards the widow.

Prince had therefore no hesitation in
saying that he had seen Mrs. Davenport,
and that she, of course, would be present
at the inquest tomorrow. He also said
he had heard Thomas Blake would be
present. He told Mr. Davenport that if
he wished to call upon the widow, her
address was at his disposal.

Mr. Davenport drew himself up hurriedly,
and looking furiously at Prince
from head to foot, as though the solicitor
was the cause of all the misfortunes, cried,
while his lips, hands, and legs were
trembling :

"1 — / go near her! Are you mad,
young sir ? Have you taken leave of
your senses, or are you jeering at me ?
I go near my brother's murderess ! Do
you take me for a conspirator too ? Do
you think I am another Blake ? I pity
you, sir. An attorney, quotha ! A man
of your trade ought to have some little
discrimination. You are for her, young
sir ! Look you : If justice can be had on
this earth, by any and all means in my
power these two shall hang side by side
on the same gibbet, and keep the company
of each other on the road to hell, and in
hell everlastingly ; " and, foaming at the
mouth, he dashed away from the astonished
pair and rushed into the house.

The inquest was to be held next day at
noon.

CHAPTER XL

MRS. DAVENPORT WAS CALLED.

The remainder of that afternoon and the
early part of next day were devoted by
young Prince to arranging details for
the inquest. He would have attached but
little importance to the wild words and
manner of Mr. Edward Davenport if there
had not been other very strong elements,
of suspicion in the case. There was matter
for more than grave suspicion — there was
matter for absolute alarm. The theory
for the defence set up by Mrs. Davenport
was puerile in the extreme, and yet he
could not make any other fit in with the

admitted facts of the case. Upon deliberate
consideration, he thought less of
his father's exposition than he had at first.
His father might be right, but his father's
conviction went no further than a supposititious
negative. In logic one could
not prove a negative ; in law there was
no prohibition. An overwhelming alibi
would insure an acquittal, but an alibi
was impossible in this case ; and by what
other means was it possible to establish a
negative ?

He was anxious to ascertain one thing :
Would Blake be arrested before or during
the inquest ? He made inquiries, and
found that, although Blake's address was
known and detectives were watching him,
no arrest would be made before the coroner
had taken some evidence. Prince had
no interest in Blake beyond the extent to
which he affected Mrs. Davenport's case.
But that was a great deal. If Blake's

mouth were shut, Mrs. Davenport's defence
would, he thought, be simpler.

The day of the inquest Prince went
to Jermyn Street, and took Mrs, Davenport
to Dulwich. She was taciturn the
whole way, and said she had nothing
to add to what she had communicated
yesterday. She hardly spoke a word
the whole way from Jermyn Street to
Heme Hill. Prince's spirits became more
depressed as they journeyed together,
but he had made up his mind to fight
the case out to the last.

The inquest was to be held at the
"Wolfdog Inn," and when Prince and
Mrs, Davenport arrived there, a large
crowd had already assembled, although
the proceedings would not begin for sometime.
Prince had engaged a private
room for Mrs. Davenport, and to it she
retired immediately on their arrival.

It was evident from the manner of

those assembled in and near the " Wolf-dog,"
that the approaching inquiry was
regarded with great interest, and that
popular feeling was aroused against the
newly-made widow.

Mrs. Davenport had entered by a back
way, and had not been observed by the
loungers. No one in the crowd knew
her ; but, of course, if she had passed
through it, she would have been recognised
instantly by her fresh weeds.

For a while young Prince stood on the
steps of the inn, and the broken snatches
of conversation which he overheard did
not help to cheer or inspirit him : he
would have taken little or no heed of
the idle talk floating in and out of the
door had he felt merely a professional
interest in this woman; but he had just
left her; he had been with her for
nearly an hour, and although few words
had passed between them in that time,

the spell of her physical beauty had
reasserted itself, and his chivalry was up
in arms for her.

While Prince was standing on the
steps of the inn, Dr. Santley and
Alfred Paulton came up. They had
walked with one another from Half Moon
Lane.

"Well," said the latter, addressing
Prince, " any good news ? "

The solicitor shook his head and
answered :

Nothing fresh." {

"I thought," said Paulton, in a tone '
of disappointment, " that Jerry O'Brien
would be with you. Is he not come ?
He said he would be here to-day."

"I have not seen him," said Prince.
I came out with Mrs. Davenport. She
is upstairs in a private room. Do you
know anything of Blake ? Have you met
him on the way ? "

"Perhaps," said Dr. Santley grimly,
"he is cultivating the acquaintance of the
police."

The speakers had moved out of earshot
of the crowd.

"No," said Prince, "I have ascertained
that he will not be touched until after
this day's work, anyway."

As the solicitor ceased speaking, two
other men approached. They, too, were
walking together ; but as they drew near
the " Wolfdog," one of them moved off to
the right, and went towards the inn
door ; the other held on towards the three
men. The latter was Jerry O'Brien.
When he came up with the little group,
and had shaken hands with them, Prince
asked :

"Who was that you were with as you
came up the road?"

"What! Don't you all know him?
Why, who could it be but Tom Blake ? "

Significant looks passed between the
three men. Paulton was the first to
speak :

"You don't mean to say, Jerry, that

you have "

"Indeed I have. I met him on the
platform at Victoria, and we came out
in the same compartment together."

Jerry O'Brien seemed as much astonished
at what he had done as his friends.

"But," urged Paulton, "you gave him
the worst of characters the day before
yesterday, and said he had something todo
with this awful affair. Since then
things have grown blacker against him,
and yet you don't cut him ! You come
out here arm-in-arm with him to the very
inquest where you say he will have to
answer the ugliest questions which can be
put to a man ! "

I bar only one thing in what you have
said, Alfred. I did not walk out with him

arm-in-arm. I met him quite accidentally
at Victoria. I told you I should be hereat
the inquest. I was on my way here.
I no more expected to see him than the
man in the moon. He pounced on me
suddenly, and rushed me. As a rule, I
can take care of myself, but I admit I am
no match for Blake. I am not sure I ever
met his match. Look here, Prince ; I
know you're a first-rate fellow at your
work. You're not as old as you might be,
but you're one of the best men in England
for this kind of a job. However, if you
have to tackle Tom Blake, he'll give you
as much as you want."

Jerry O'Brien spoke with heightened
colour, and in a tone of intense irritation.

This opinion was not unwelcome to
Prince's ears, for he knew that, no matter
how big a scoundrel Blake might be, he
would say nothing to inculpate Mrs.
Davenport.

"What is this Blake's manner?" asked
Prince.

Perfectly self-possessed, cool and
audacious."

Is he venturesome ? M

He'd play for his boots or his shirt,
and then for his skin."

"Do you think, O'Brien, he'll get out
of this with a whole skin ? "

He may, for you are not his lawyer,"
said O'Brien, with a laugh.

It is an old form of joke," said the
attorney, with a smile. " Do you know
if he has got legal assistance ? "

Legal assistance ! " cried O'Brien, scornfully.
" Not he. He laughed when telling
me some fellows said he ought to get legal
assistance. Why, my dear Prince, he'd
give the best of you thirty out of a
hundred, and win the game by making
you give misses. When is this thing to
begin ? "

"Presently. Have you any notion of
what he is going to say at the inquest ? "

I asked him. I told him the paper
found in the handwriting of the deceased
would be very awkward."

"What did he say?"

"That it looked very awkward, no
doubt ; but that many people got into
awkward positions and got out of them
again."

I asked him had he been summoned
as a witness, and he said naturally he had,
as he was the last person who saw the
dead man alive."

"By Jove, O'Brien! Go on."

I asked him how he thought the death
occurred. He said that was beyond him
to say. He had no doubt it was accidental,
and that the memorandum on the piece
of paper written under the influence of
delirium might be an idea created by
chloroform, or while suffering from a relapse

of the old disease which seized him at
Florence years ago."

The same story identically. Did he
say anything more ? "

"Yes. I asked him did anything unpleasant
occur between himself and Mr.
Davenport that night ? "

What did he say to that ? " eagerly
asked the attorney.

He looked at me doubtfully for a
moment. c O'brien he said, c you know
more about this than the outside public.
You are interested in it ? ' I said I was
interested in it very indirectly. 'Very
well, then,' said he, ' I'm going to the
inquest. You come with me and then you
shall hear the truth as far as 1 know
it'"

"This put me in a queer fix. I had
not up to this told him I was on my way
to this place. I could not keep the fact
any longer to myself, so I told him I

expected to find friends here, nothing
more ; and I asked him if I might communicate
the substance of what he had
said to them. He gave me full liberty.
After all this, you will see I could not
very well shake him off. When we got
here he shook himself off. Mrs. Davenport's
name was never mentioned by either of
us. He did not show the least curiosity
when I said I took an indirect interest
in the case."

A few minutes after this the four men
moved into the inn, and the coroner having
arrived, the jury were sworn, and after returning
from Crescent House, the business
of taking evidence began.

After formal identification of the body
by Mr. Edward Davenport, the witness
examined was Alfred Paulton. He told
his story simply and briefly, and answered
the questions of the coroner and jury with
precision. When what may be regarded

as the examination-inches was over, Mr.
Bertram Spencer, legal representative of
Mr. Edward Davenport, put a few questions
through the coroner. Paulton's replies were
in effect :

No, he had never seen Mr. Davenport
alive. When Dr. Santley and he entered
the room where Mr. Davenport lay, deceased
was then dead. At least, so he believed.
He had no acquaintance with the effects
of chloroform. He had never been in the
room with a dead person before. Mrs.
Davenport, upon his invitation, accompanied
him to his father's house, also in
Half Moon Lane. Paulton was asked a
few more questions, but nothing new came
out.

Dr. Santley was then examined. He
stated that Mr. Paulton called him on
the morning of the death. That he went
immediately, as he happened to be dressed
and disengaged at the time. He found

Mr. Davenport quite dead. He thought
life had been extinct for an hour or so ;
it was impossible to say accurately. The
body was not cold. He was familiar with
cases of spasmodic asthma. Practically
it never killed directly ; that is, one never
died of the spasm. In a spasm, the heart,
or head, or lungs, or aorta might give way,
causing death. He had never known a
case of death from spasmodic asthma, pure
and simple.

He was, of course, familiar with chloroform
as an anaesthetic. He had once seen
a case of poisoning by chloroform. That
case was accidental. Chloroform was frequently
used as a palliative in severe cases
of asthma. A small quantity sprinkled on
a napkin or handkerchief and held close
to the nose and mouth very often afforded
temporary relief. This treatment had no
effect on the disease beyond mitigating the
violence or putting an end to the spasm.

VOL. I. M

Chloroform should always be administered
with great care, as it had frequently been
known to cause death. In the present case
he found no napkin or handkerchief lying
near the body. In administering chloroform
for spasmodic asthma, the usual way
was to fold a napkin so that when open
it would resemble rudely a funnel. Into
the sharper end of the funnel the chloroform
was dropped, and then the mouth and
nose of the patient thrust into the more
open end. The handkerchief of deceased
showed no trace of being used in the
administration of chloroform, nor did either
of the napkins found in the room. There
was a very strong smell of chloroform
about the place, and a large, a very large
quantity had been spilled over the beard
and shirt and waistcoat of deceased. The
bottle produced was what was known asa
two-ounce bottle. The full of it, or half
the full of it would, if sprinkled over the

shirt and beard and waistcoat, in all likelihood
cause death, provided the natural
course of the vapour upwards towards the
mouth and nostrils was not interfered with.
He could form no certain opinion as to
the cause of death. He had declined to
certify because he did not know. He
would prefer giving no opinion. The
brain, or aorta, or heart might have
given way without displaying any external
symptom. If the lungs had yielded, there
would no doubt have been an outward
sign. In deaths by chloroform he was
not acquainted with any infallible outward
sign. A post-mortem examination
would, he thought, determine the cause of
death.

A few questions were then put on behalf
of Mrs. Davenport. The case of poisoning
by chloroform which had come directly
under his notice was unquestionably
accidental. A man who suffered acutely

m 2

from neuralgia was in the habit of using
chloroform to allay pain. He was found
dead in his bed one morning with an
empty bottle, which had contained an
ounce of the drug, by the side of his face
and partly under the clothes. It was
possible, but very unlikely, that in the
present case the bottle might have been
accidentally emptied by deceased. Chloroform
was denser than water, and would
not run out of such a bottle very quickly.
It was most unlikely that any man in
possession of his senses would allow an
ounce and a half of that fluid to escape
from such a bottle and fall on his beard
and chest. Assuming he was recumbent
at the time, he would be obliged to hold
the bottle on a level with his eyes in
order to pour the spirit on his beard, and
he would have to hold the bottle in that
position for an appreciable time. In his

opinion, the poison had not got on
deceased accidentally.

Up to this point the questions had all
been put through the coroner. Now
Prince suggested that it would be for
the convenience of all concerned if he
himself might, by favour of the coroner,
directly interrogate the witness. This was
agreed to, the coroner, before proceeding
any further, giving notice that no further
evidence 'Would be taken that day, and
that as soon as Dr. Santley's evidence was
concluded, the inquiry would be adjourned
pending the result of the post-mortem
examination.

At this announcement Mr. Prince expressed
the greatest surprise. He had
been curious to learn why the medical
evidence had been gone into so early in
the case. But knowing the coroner always
acted with the greatest tact and judgment,

he had made no remark at the time. For
his part, he believed such a course, if
followed, would be found very inconvenient.


Mrs. Davenport, in whose interest he
was watching the case, was particularly-anxious
to be examined to-day, as she
felt the strain of expectation in such an
ordeal very great.

The coroner said if Mrs. Davenport was
anxious to be examined he should be
happy to take her evidence.

In that case Mr. Prince begged as a
favour that he might be allowed to reserve
the few questions he had to ask Dr.
Santley until after Mrs. Davenport had
been examined. To this also, after a little
show of resistance, the coroner acceded.

Prince had resolved to have her evidence
taken to-day at any risk. Several
reasons urged him to this determination.
It would look better, or, rather, less badin

the eyes of the public to state that
in a week's time her strength would be
diminished by waiting and anxiety ; and to
get her examined thus, after the point at
which the coroner had intended practically
to close the evidence for that day would,
he felt certain, tend to mitigate the rigours
of the examination.

Mrs. Davenport was called.

ANOTHER WITNESS.

There was a slight commotion in the dingy-room
when this woman with the lovely
figure and beautiful head and face entered.
The coroner straightened himself and
looked at her under his spectacles. The
jury leaned forward and stared, and the
few members of the general public who
had succeeded in gaining admission to the
room strained their necks and shuffled
their feet.

She advanced quietly to the table at
which the coroner sat, with the jury on
his right, and having thrown back her

thick widow's veil and unloved her right
hand, took the Book and kissed it when
the proper moment for doing so arrived.
The coroner pointed to a chair, and told
her she might be seated. She simply
bowed and remained standing.

She was pale, rigid, collected. The
coroner busied himself with the pens, ink,
and paper before him for a little while,
and then asked her to tell them all she
knew of the night and event under consideration.


When she spoke her voice was clear
.and firm — as free from emotion as though
she was repeating an old task by rote.
The earlier portions of what she said maybe
partly omitted, for they have been
already related to Alfred Paulton and
Richard Prince. For the sake of conciseness,
the remainder of the evidence taken
that day will, in the case of each witness,
follow the order of events in narrative

form, and not the order of events as
given by the witnesses.

She and her husband arrived at
Crescent House the night he died. He
was not so well as usual, but she had
known the asthma more troublesome.
They had supper together. He ate more
sparingly than usual. They were alone in
the house. He decided upon resting on
the couch all night. No room but her
sleeping room was in anything like order.
She was tired after the journey. They
had come from Chester that day. Her
husband suggested she should go to bed.
At about ten o'clock she went to her
room, but resolved not to lie down yet,
as she was anxious about her husband,
and resolved to see him once more, and
put more coal on the fire before retiring
finally. She sat down in a chair, and,
being overcome with fatigue and drowsiness,
fell asleep. She had no means of

telling exactly when she fell asleep, but
she thought she must have been about
twenty minutes in her room before she
grew unconscious.

"Close to midnight she awoke with a
start. It must have been the opening of
the dining-room door that aroused her.
She had left her bed-room door ajar, and
the carpets not being down, sounds were
exaggerated and travelled far.

She listened and heard voices — the
voices of two people, two men. She knew
the two voices. One was that of her
husband — the other that of Mr. Thomas
Blake. Both voices seemed friendly, but
she did not catch the words. Shortly
after she heard Mr. Blake distinctly say
Good-night,' and her husband answer
Good-night, Blake She was quite
positive these were the words spoken,
and that the tones were friendly — yes,
she was prepared to swear, cordial. Then

she heard a man's footstep on the uncarpeted
boards of the hall, and in a
moment the front door was closed.

"Some time elapsed before she went
down — half-an-hour, or perhaps a little
more. She had a reason for not going
down immediately. From the time the
front door was shut until she went down
she had not heard a sound, not the
faintest sound, in the house. A slight
noise arising in the dining-room, where
she had left Mr. Davenport, would be
inaudible to her ; but she felt almost
certain no one could in that interval of
time enter or leave the house without
her hearing him.

"At twenty minutes past twelve she
descended and crept cautiously into the
dining-room, wishing not to disturb her
husband if he should be sleeping. Her
husband was reclining on the couch in
very nearly the same attitude she had

left him ; it was such as he always took
when his cough prevented his lying
down.

She believed he was sleeping, and stood
gazing at him for a few seconds. Then,
becoming uneasy, she did not know why,
she called him several times, and failing
to arouse him with her voice, she placed
her hand on his shoulder. She now
became grievously alarmed, for he had
always been a remarkably light sleeper.
She listened for his breathing, but could
hear nothing.

After a few moments she became terrified,
desperate, and, going to the front door,
opened it and attracted the attention of
Mr. Paulton, who in a short time brought
Dr. Santley, who said he was dead.

Yes ; she identified that bottle. It was
the one in which her husband used to keep
chloroform. He had the bottle always by
him. When she left him to go to her

room that night two hours earlier the
bottle was more than three-quarters full
of chloroform, and the cork was in it.
Thirty or forty drops was the quantity
her husband generally used at a time.
He always spilled the chloroform into a
napkin formed into a rude resemblance of
a cornucopia, and then inhaled it. To
her knowledge, he never used the drug
internally, nor in any way but that
described.

"I have known Mr. Thomas Blake for
many years. We were once secretly
engaged to be married, but my father
broke the matter off, and I married Mr.
Davenport, who was much older than I —
twenty-five or twenty-six years older.
When Mr. Blake was a very young man
he met Mr. Davenport abroad, so my
late husband told me. It was Mr. Blake
introduced my late husband to me. At
that time Mr. Blake and I were secretly

engaged. After this engagement was known
to my father and broken off by him, as
far as his forbidding me to see Mr. Blake,
I still communicated with Mr. Blake and
received letters from him. These were
surreptitious communications.

Mr. Davenport then proposed to me
and I refused him. Shortly after this
I received a letter from Mr. flake, saying
there was no use in our continuing too



hope w T e should one day be married, as
neither of us had any money or the chance
of getting any, and consequently we ought
to make up our minds to resign ourselves
to fate. Shortly after this Mr. Davenport
proposed to me again and I accepted him.
We were married a few months later, and
have most of the time since then resided
at Mr. Davenport's place near Kilcash, in
the county of Waterford.

"The terms upon which Mr. Blake gave
me up will be told you by himself. I

had nothing to do with that bargain.
After an absence of a little time from
Ireland, Mr. Blake came back and stayed
occasionally in Kilcash, close to which my
husband's house was. I saw little of
Mr. Blake. My husband met him now
and then. In those days I believe Mr.
Blake gave me up solely for the reason
mentioned in the letter of which I have
spoken. Subsequently I found out other
considerations had been working in Mr.
Blake's mind.

"My marriage with Mr. Davenport was
not a love-match. A variety of reasons
urged me into marrying him. Among
these reasons I cannot count love. I have
diligently, conscientiously done my duty
by him for ten years. I never pretended
or professed to love him. I respected his
moral code, but his social and intellectual
faculties did not impress, did not interest
me, and certainly did not gain my esteem.

We Lived in peace and comfort. He
never once quarrelled with me — I never
with him.

"I said I had a reason for not going
down immediately after Mr. Blake left
the house the other night. My reason
was that generally after a visit from Mr.
Blake, Mr. Davenport was unpleasantly
excited with, as I even then thought, a
lingering feeling of jealousy. At such
times he never said anything harsh or
unpleasant of Mr. Blake or of myself,
but he was certain to become feverishly
angry with some one or other ; and believing
that after such a journey, and with
so bad a cough, it would be injurious to
him to excite himself unduly, I kept back
awhile.

I had the strongest possible objection
to having this unhappy occurrence made
the object of official inquiry or public
comment. I would not have spoken as

VOL. I. n

I have since I came in here for any other
consideration in the world than my inability
to tell anything that is not true.

I would not swear anything that was
not true to save my life ; no, nor to save
the life of any one living or any one who
has lived. You ask me did I not perjure
myself when I swore at the altar to love
my late husband. I say I did not. When
I took that oath I meant to keep it. I
meant to try and love him with all my
I will not say heart — with all my reason,
if such an expression may be allowed.
I was fully honest when I took the oath.
When you do all you can to carry out
your promise, and yet fail in the end,
there is no flaw. One cannot control the
inevitable.

Now that all is known, all my recent
life laid bare, who is the richer ? Does
anv one wonder I had no liking to expose
what has been told of since I came into

this place ? You, Mr. Edward Davenport,
have, in the moment of her sorest trial,
done all you could to injure the character
of your brother's wife. You had not the
courage to attack her openly when she
was a widow, but must shamble and crouch
behind a hireling advocate — a creature who
would pocket as clean the gold of any one
even more leprous than himself."

And before the coroner could collect himself,
or stay her by gesture, sbe had swept
out of the room.

From beginning to end her voice had
never altered in pitch. The concluding
words were spoken in the same manner
as those of the opening. Hence when
the import of her final words began to
reach the minds of the hearers, she had
finished, and was in the act of leaving
the room. Her words " shamble " and
"crouch" were peculiarly applicable to
Edward Davenport at the time, for no

N 2

sooner did she begin her reference to him
than she pointed him out, and he instinctively
shrank behind his solicitor,
to whom he had been prompting questions
most offensive.

When the murmur which followed the
disappearance of Mrs. Davenport had subsided,
and the coroner had somewhat
recovered from his astonishment, Thomas
Blake stood up, stepped forward to the
table, and, laying his hand on it, said :

I am the last person who saw Mr.
Louis Davenport alive. I desire to be
examined."

BLAKE S EVIDENCE.

When Blake stood up and tendered his
testimony, a murmur of ugly import ran
through the room. In all there were not
more than fifty people present, but the
fifty were typical of the general public,
and already feeling ran high against
Blake.

He looked around contemptuously,
defiantly. At one moment it seemed as
though he was about to laugh outright.
The public can endure anything better
than derision. The murmur grew to a
groan. Silence was called in a tyrannical

tone. The coroner pushed his spectacles
up on his forehead, and regarded Blake
steadfastly for a few seconds.

A square-built man, of medium height,
stood before the judge. His hair was
short, crisp, grizzled. He wore his hat
jauntily in front of his waistcoat, and
had an eye-glass fixed in his left eye. In
the hand which held his hat he carried a
stout oak stick. His hat was a soft felt
one ; his clothes light, coarse tweed, of
pepper-and-salt colour. His brow was
firm, low, and handsome ; his complexion
iiorid, the colour of his eyes bright blue.
He wore no hair on his face but heavy,
grizzled mustachios. His boots were
patent leather. He was unloved.

The coroner, an old and venerable-looking
man, viewed Blake with anything
but favour.

"Do I understand you to say, sir, that

you are the person who saw deceased last
before his death ? "

This was said in a grave, monitory-tone.


So I believe," said Blake, lightly ;
and as I am most anxious to tell all I
know, I should like to be examined before
the adjournment."

I had determined to take no more
evidence to-day than would warrant mein
adjourning until a post-mortem examination
could be made."

Well, if you examine me, it may save
the police trouble."

The coroner looked at the inspector who
w T as watching the case, and then at Prince
and Bertram Spencer, who were watching
the case for the widow and brother of the
deceased. The inspector looked down and
smiled ; Prince looked up at the ceiling
in unpleasant doubt ; but Spencer, who

represented Mr. Edward Davenport, was
urgent that Blake should be heard. The
public were also anxious Blake should be
examined. The public were athirst for
blood or scandal. In this case the publie
was unwashed and evil-visaged. Even the
jury, who were not there by choice, had
a forbidding, ghoul-like, and clayey look.
The coroner was scrupulously clean. He
was blanched and ghostly. Alfred Paulton
looked like one suffering from a hideous
nightmare. The inspector was grim, sardonic,
rigid ; the coroner s clerk sullen
and sleepy, and seemed to think the
last thing which in fairness ought to
trouble a coroner's clerk was a coroner's
inquest.

In that dull, saddened room, lit by the
wan February light, the only bright-looking
figure or face was that of Thomas
Blake, upon whom rested a strong suspicion
of murder.

After some talk and thought, the coroner
resolved to take Thomas Blake's evidence,
and having cautioned the witness, which
made the witness smile in a way that provoked
the public, he took down Blake's
version of the story. Again it will
be most convenient to throw the evidence
into the form of uninterrupted
narrative :

I am now thirty-six years of age. I
have known the late Mr. Davenport for
many years. I knew him abroad before
I met him in Ireland. It was in Florence
that I met him first. I was introduced
to him by an American gentleman, a
sculptor by profession. I saw a good
deal of Mr. Davenport when I was in
Florence. I am now speaking of eleven
or twelve years ago. While I was on
friendly terms with him in that city his
mind was affected. He suffered from a
delusion that there was a conspiracy to

kill and rob him. He usually at that
time carried valuable jewels and considerable
sums of money on his person. I
often advised him to give up that habit,
but my words for some time produced no
effect on him. Then, all at once, they
seemed to operate, and he turned on me
and said, with great fury, that if there
were danger to his property or person he
had no one to fear but me.

At that time I was a needy man, and
I had borrowed money of him, which I
have never repaid. That is so. During
the time Mr. Davenport was ill — was
suffering from this delusion or suspicion
I was constantly with him. I do not
think he disclosed to any one but me
the delusions or suspicions he was under.
When he recovered he made me swear
most solemnly I would never tell a soul.
Then he lent me, or, if you prefer it, gave
me, more money, and left Florence, and

I lost sight of him until I met him in
Ireland.

I do not consider my conduct in that
matter dishonourable. I had done him a
service by minding him and keeping his
malady private, and he gave me money
for my services. Yes, and for my silence,
if you like.

"I do not know whether my conduct
would be considered gentlemanly. I am
not here to give an opinion, but to state
facts. If an opinion of gentlemanly conduct
is required, why not have an attorney's
clerk from the purlieus of Lincoln's Inn
Fields as an expert ? I beg your pardon,
sir, I should not have used such words,
but I heard that question suggested by
Mr. Davenport.

I did not again see the late Mr.
Davenport on the Continent. The next
time we met was in Ireland. Yes ; at
that time I was paying attentions to

Mrs. Davenport, who was then Miss
Butler. When the deceased came on the
scene, Miss Butler and I were secretly
engaged to one another — engaged to one
another without the knowledge of Miss
Butler's father. I was then practically
without means or the reasonable expectation
of getting any ; but, then, few young
men in such a position are very particular
as to whether the expectation is reasonable
or not. If they expect, that is enough
for them."

Then the witness gave evidence in these
line as that of the widow. While
this part of the inquiry was progressing,
a light rain began to fall. The evidence
of Blake went on :

"It was I who broke off the engagement
between Miss Butler and myself. By the
time that occurred, Mr. Butler had discovered
the existence of the private
engagement. He was very indignant, and

forbade me his house. This was at
Scrouthea, Mr. Butler's place in the county
of Cork.

I took no notice of Mr. Butler's prohibition.
I communicated with Miss
Butler as often as I thought fit and could
find an opportunity. But at this time I
began to feel there would be no chance of
our ever marrying. The opposition of
Mr. Butler continued undiminished. Mr.
Davenport did not cease to importune,
and at that time I lost the last money I
had in the world on a horse.

It was not purely matters of prudence
that made me desist in my suit. I saw
now quite plainly there was no use in my
continuing to hope. Persistence would
only waste the lives of both of us. All
this time Mr. Davenport and I were on
speaking terms. I was in no fear of his
supplanting me in the affections of Miss
Butler, and he was in abject fear of me.

His fear of me arose from the power
I had of telling of the seizure to which
I had seen him subjected in Florence.
Like all men who are a little odd, his
great aversion was from being thought
odd, and the notion of any one suspecting
him of insanity filled him with absolute
horror.

To be brief, I told him I had lost the
last shilling I had in the world, and that
consequently I had made up my mind
Miss Butler and I could never more be
anything else but friends, and that I
would leave the country if I had the
means. He asked me to say nothing
about what I had seen in Florence, shook
me by the hand, and lent or gave me a
thousand pounds. With that thousand
pounds I went out of the country. Before
leaving, I wrote to Miss Butler saying all
must be at an end between us because of

my poverty, arising from my loss on the
Turf.

How much did I lose on the horse ?
Let me see. All I had. How much was
that ? Let me see again. About seven
hundred and fifty pounds."

But when Mr. Davenport had given
you the thousand pounds, you were better
off than before the race. Why, then, did
you renounce Miss Butler ? "

"Yes, no doubt, I was even better off;
but do you think I could honourably
employ this man's money in taking away
from him the woman he loved ? "

And do you think it was honourable
for you to give her up, and take hush
money from your rival ? "

"I am here, as I said before, to state
facts, not to give opinions. When gentlemen
want opinions, they hire lawyers to
give them."

You gave up the lady to whom you
were engaged, and black-mailed your
friend for a thousand pounds ? "

I give up the facts to you. It is
the duty of the attorney to embellish
them. I am not, Mr. Coroner, bound
to answer questions which are simply
rhetorical."

The coroner merely shook his head, and
the evidence went on :

From the day I bade Mr. Davenport
good-bye in Ireland, ten years ago, until
the day of his death, I often saw Mr.
Davenport, and spoke to him."

And you heard from him ? You received
communications from him ? "

"Yes."

"And money?"

Yes, from time to time I received
money from him by letter."

Was that money black mail ? "

"I wrote him saying I was in want

of money, and he sent me money accompanied
by friendly letters. You are at
liberty to call it what you like. If you
search his papers, no doubt you will find
my letters to him. -I did not keep copies
of them, nor did I keep his replies.

Yes ; I had an object in calling on
him the night he died. I had heard he
was in London, or coming to London,
and I got the address in Dulwich. I
had business with him. It was to get
more money from him. You may say
extract more money from him ' if you like.

I knocked at the door. He opened
it himself. He complained of his asthma,
said there was no servant in the house,
and that Mrs. Davenport had gone to bed.
He asked me to go into the dining-room,
which I found as has been described, and
we sat and chatted for some time in a
most agreeable manner. We talked of
indifferent things. Of course we spoke

VOL. I. O

of Mrs. Davenport. He said, in talking
of her, that although theirs had not been
a love-match, they had got on wonderfully
well together, and that he was quite happy,
and he believed she was contented. He
asked how long I purposed staying in
London, and I said only a few days.
Then he invited me to call on Mrs.
Davenport and himself when they were
in better trim "

What — what is that you say ? " shouted
Mr. Edward Davenport, starting to his
feet and gesticulating wildly. "It's perjury
— wilful and corrupt perjury ! "

It was with the greatest difficulty
Bertram Spencer could prevail upon his
client to resume his seat and keep silent.
After a while Blake was allowed to continue
his evidence :

I promised to come the next evening
but one, and he said that would suit
them admirably. Then he smiled and

said he was sure this was not merely a
visit of ceremony, and that he supposed I
would allow him to be of any use I chose.
I told him he was quite right, that I
had no money, and that two hundred
pounds would be of the greatest service
to me at that moment. He said he had
not so much by him, but that he would
give me a hundred now and another hundred
when I called the next day but
one. ' That will be,' said he, ' the 19th
of February.' He added that he'd make
a memorandum of it, and he did so in
the pocket-book which has been produced
here by the police. After that nothing
passed but ' Good-nights ' on both sides,
and then I went away, closing the front
door after me."

Here reference was made to the pocketbook,
but no such entry as that described
could be found. There was no such entry
in the book.

o 2

Then, having cautioned the witness again,
the coroner said two leaves of the book
had been torn out, one of which had been
found. On the leaf found appeared words
of the gravest import. They were :

Pretended death. Blake gone. He
emptied chloroform over me — held me
down. Can't stir. Dying."

Could witness give any explanation of
this?

"No; I can give no explanation of
that writing. It is perfectly untrue.
When I left the presence of the man
now dead he seemed to be in as good
health as his asthma would allow. My
only way of accounting for what followed
is that, after my leaving, he administered
some chloroform to himself. This disturbed
his reason, and he suffered from
a return of the old delusion he had suffered
in Florence "

And of which you are the only living
person who knows, or ever did know,
anything ? "

Yes."

And further ? "

And further, that while suffering under
this delusion, and being greatly excited
and rendered tremulous by it, he accidentally
spilled the remainder of the chloroform
over himself'

He did not show any suicidal tendency,
or say anything of suicide while you were
present ? "

"No ; on the contrary, he seemed in
very good spirits, and spoke quite cheerfully
of the future. By-the-way, I forgot
to mention one saying of his. When
asking me to come and see Mrs. Davenport
and himself on the 19th, he said, 'You
know I am not afraid of a rival now.
We are none of us as young as we were

ten years ago, and if you have kept single
with the notion of marrying a rich widow
she will be rich, Blake — yon will have
a weary time to wait ; for asthma gives
a long lease to life."

Here the inquiry was adjourned for four
days in order to give time for the £>o,<tf-
mortem examination.

As the people began to leave their
places, Richard Prince whispered to Jerry
O'Brien :

"That man Blake has put his head into
the halter and kicked away the barrel
from under his feet."

When Prince and O'Brien got out of
that room in the "Wolfdog," they looked
everywhere for Alfred Paulton. He was
not to be found. He had disappeared,
leaving no word or trace behind him.

As Blake left the inn, two men, dressed
like stable-helpers, came up to him and

said they arrested him on suspicion of
being concerned in the murder of the late
Mr. Louis Davenport.

The rain was now falling in torrents.

ALFRED Carlton's WALK.

It was now pitch dark. The rain rushed
downward through the still air in overwhelming
sheets. Through the leafless
trees it fell with a shrill, constant hiss.
On the open road it beat with a loud
dull rolling sound, sometimes like the dull
murmur of distant traffic, sometimes like,
the distant roar of a mighty concourse of
people.

Out beyond the lamps of the town there
was not a glimmer of light to be seen anywhere.
If one turned one's face upwards,
the source of the rain seemed not to be

more than a few feet overhead. If one
turned one's face to the ground, a thick
heavy vapour, born of the shattered drops,
rose warm against one's mouth and eyes.
There was no noise abroad but that of'
the incessant deluge. If it had abated
or increased, one would have thought it
was the result of a thunder-storm. But
it did not alter in character or decree.
It was a constant torrent, not a fitful
flood.

It was between six and seven o'clock
when Alfred Paulton found himself walking
on a lonely road under this fierce downpour.
How he got there he did not know.
He had a confused memory of what had
taken place within the past few hours.
He had no clue whatever to where he
now was. He had no more than a blurred
image of the scene in that low, dingy, delighted
room at the " "Wolfdog Inn." Even
when Mrs. Davenport was giving evidence

his attention had been but feebly aroused
He had felt drowsy, jaded. He then told
himself that it would be much better for
him to go home and have some rest and
sleep. He had been without proper sleep
for three nights. He had been too much
excited to get to sleep soundly, and when
for a time he fell into an uneasy doze y
he had awakened with a shudder and a
start from some dire form of nightmare,
in which familiar forms and faces had been
cruelly jumbled in hideous events.

But on this unknown road, and now,
after wandering he knew not how long
all at once he was smitten with a sharp
impression of his present situation. He
moved his eyes this way and that in quick
anxiety. It is not possible to say he
looked in the sense that looking takes in
objects by means of sight. He could hear
and feel the rain, and smell the heavy
damp vapour rising from the ground, from

the flooded road at his feet. But if sight
had been painlessly taken from him at that
moment, he would have been unconscious
of loss.

A feeling of desolation and infrangible
solitude came upon him.

He paused in his walk and listened.
His ears caught nothing but the muffled
hiss of the rain through the air, the angry-beat
of it among the leafless trees, and
the slashing singing of it on the flooded
ground. The effect of it was an awful
combination of the darkness of the grave,,
an inviolate solitude, and a deluge lacking
merciful power to overwhelm.

He would have greeted any companion
with joy. The society of the humblest
beast, the most abject man, would have-cheered
him almost beyond the bounds of
reason.

The completeness of his isolation was
not due merely to external forces combined

with physical and mental exhaustion.
The hollow spaces of his imagination
were filled with ghostly hints of an
unendurable crime. In the caverns of his
thought was no pageant of people or of
things. No words or echoes of words
sounded through the dim, deplorable
vaults. Everywhere within there was the
look of sacrilege by bloodshed, the faint
unendurable replication of dying groans.
The marks of a red hand were on all the
walls, the last moans of a murdered man
filled the concave gloom.

He had heard that man Brake give his
evidence freely, almost jauntily. He had
seen that other man lying dead in the
disordered room. As he had listened to
the evidence of Blake, he had felt the air
about his head grow cold with awe, while
his whole frame froze with terror. All
the people in the room where that accursed
tale was told believed instinctively that this

man, talking with such odious glibness, was
a perjurer and an assassin.

Ugh ! It was horrible — too horrible fora
sane human being to dwell upon ! He
would give all he had in the world to
be able to banish the memory of the past
few days from his mind. But a curse
had fallen upon him, and now no other
event of all his life would stay with him
for one brief minute to keep him away from
this awful scene.

When in that room where the inquest
was held he had felt very cold. Now he
was hot, uncomfortably hot. This was
strange ; for there he had been under
cover, and there had been a fire in the
room. Here not only was he in the open
aii, but under a fierce downpour of rain.
Indeed it was one of the greatest storms
of rain he had ever been out in. The
rain was useful in one way — it would cool
him.

Ah, that was much better ! To take
off his hat and let the cool rain beat on
his bare head was a luxury — a delicious
luxury. It was indeed a luxury such ashe
had wished for in vain a little while
ago ; for it not only took away the great,
unaccountable heat from which he would
otherwise have suffered most severely, but,
better a thousandfold, it kept his mind
from running on the events of a few days
back, and this day in particular. The
effect of rain falling on his bare head was
to banish thought from the brain, and give
the brain rest.

What an extraordinary thing the brain
was ! Awhile ago he had been able to
recall hardly any of the circumstances of
the inquest ; then they all rushed into his
mind, causing him great disquietude ; and
now the mere falling of rain on his uncovered
head had put him into a wholesome
and almost pleasant state of mind !

The heat was gradually getting less.
Yes, there could be no mistake about
that. A few minutes since it seemed as
though it would take hours to reduce the
temperature to the degree it had already
reached. Keeping the hat off was no
longer necessary. In fact, it was no
longer comfortable to go uncovered. He
would put on his hat.

He was wet through now — thoroughly
wet. He must have been soaked before
that great heat came upon him. It was
very extraordinary that he should feel so
hot while the water was absolutely running
down under his clothes.

Ah, a chill now ! Unmistakably a chill,
and he could see no sign of human habitation
anywhere — no place which could
afford him shelter. In fact, he could
make nothing whatever out except the
rain, and that was revealed to him by
the sense of touch, not by the sense of

sight. How cold the rain was, too ! He
had never felt rain so cold. The air
must then be twenty degrees colder than
it had been a few minutes ago. He had
never until now experienced so sudden a
fall of temperature.

He was shivering, too. His teeth were
chattering. How delighted he would be
to find any kind of shelter, and a good
fire to warm himself at ! This was very
lonely and wretched. He was hardly able
to walk now, and yet with his present
chill anything was better than to stand.
The thought of sitting down was out of
the question. No one but a madman
would sit down in such rain, and with
clothes soaked through. He had been
miserably wrong to uncover his head for
so Ions: a time. To that foolish act must
be attributed this chill. Ugh ! he was
barely able to stagger along. This was

the most dismal night he had ever passed
in all his life.

But uncovering his head to the rain
was not the only foolish thing he had
done this night. Had he not wandered
sillily along some roads — he knew not
where — until he had lost his way ? Now
he was far from lamplight — where he knew
not ; whither to turn he could not decide
if he had a choice. At present he every
now and then ran up against the hedge,
and this was the only thing which told
him he was walking on a road.

He wondered what o'clock it was. When
did he leave that dreadful room where
the inquest had been held? He could
not tell, but it was the moment Blake's
evidence was over. The moment Blake
moved from the table at which the coroner
sat, he had stolen away, and, he thought,
run a good while, until he was out of

VOL. i. p

breath. How long that was since he
could not tell — could not guess.

Merciful Heavens ! Suppose the night
was yet young — suppose it was now no
more than midnight, or eleven, or ten
o'clock — what was to become of him %
There would be no daylight until close to
seven. Could it be that he would have
to wander on thus for eight or ten hours
more ? The thought was absurd. He
should drop down of exhaustion, of cold,
long before that time.

Cold ! Why, what could be the meaning
of this ? Already the feeling of
cold was passing away, and he felt quite
warm — very hot. This was an improvement
on the sensation a little while
ago.

No matter whether he felt hot or cold
now, this day had done him one invaluable
service. It had cured him of any
romantic feeling he had had for that

strangely beautiful woman. Now all that
had happened in that room where the
inquest had been held came back vividly
to him. Murder had been done, and
there could be no doubt in the mind of
any reasonable man that Blake had done

the awful deed, and that she No,

no ; he mustn't think that even now. It
was plain, at all events, that Blake had
once been loved by her, and there was
nothing to show that she was now indifferent
to Blake. Had she not supported
his absurd theory respecting the death of
the man who had been murdered ?

The heat was becoming bad again —
worse than ever. His head was burning.
It felt as though a cap of tight-fitting
metal pressed upon it. The cold of a
little time back was hard to endure, but
it seemed a positive pleasure compared
with this awful sensation of bursting at

the temples. He must have relief someway,
any way, no matter at what cost
in the future.

Off with the hat again. The rain did
not cool so quickly or so effectually, but
it afforded great alleviation. There was no
positive sense of pleasure from it now —
only a dulling, deadening of a feeling which
was not exactly pain, but gave rise to a
helpless, lethargic state of brain.

His limbs w r ere heavier than they had
yet seemed, and he had great difficulty
in persuading himself that the water
which rose no higher than an inch on
the road was not tenacious mud half a
foot deep.

Keep on thus for several hours ! Impossible
! One might as well expect to
walk for the same time on red-hot ploughshares.


Oh, he felt sick and weary beyond
endurance ! No light to be seen — nothing

whatever visible. And along this road
no succour was likely to come, while the
rain poured down as though a second
destruction of earth by water was at
hand.

What ! — cold again so soon ! Distracting
! Maddening !

Ah, this was fever — fever of some awful
kind — and no help at hand. He could
not keep on another hour. Bah ! — not
half-an-hour.

Merciful heavens, what was this ? Lights
and the sounds of horses and the shouts of
men !

He felt himself knocked down. With a
prodigious effort he staggered to his feet
and cried out :

Help ! — for heavens sake, help ! "

Succour had arrived at the last moment.


I SHALL BE READY FOR MY DEATH WHEN
THEY ARE READY FOR IT ! "

That evening, when Richard Prince ascertained
Alfred Paulton had left the " Wolf-dog
Inn," he came to the conclusion that
he had hastened home with an account
of the day's proceedings. He resolved to
go and seek Mrs. Davenport at once.

He had ordered a carriage to be in
readiness to take her and him back to
London. Since she had finished giving
her evidence, she had remained in the
private room upstairs. The rain was
now falling heavily.

As the solicitor stood on the doorstep
under the portico bidding Jerry O'Brien
good-evening, he saw the two men, who
looked like stable-helpers, go up to Tom
Blake and speak to him. He had noticed
these men during the day, and when he
saw them speak to Blake, he knew what
their business with him was.

On a motion from one of the two, a cab
drew up a little way from the door of the
inn. Tom Blake and the two men got
into it, and the cab drove off. Then
Prince went back into the inn, spoke a
few words to the police inspector, and
sent up word to Mrs. Davenport that he
and the carriage were ready.

In a few minutes she came down, looking
as calm and impassible as ever. With
some commonplace remarks about the rain,
he handed her in, and then took his seat
beside her.

For a while they drove in perfect silence

She broke it by asking what had occurred
since she left the room downstairs.

He briefly told her the substance of
Blake's evidence, softening down the sentimental
portions as far as they had relation
to herself, but setting forth fully and fairly
the salient points of his history.

She listened without a word. She had
heard the coroner say the inquiry would
not close that day. She therefore knew
nothing final was to be decided immediately.
But although Prince knew she
was aware of this, he was surprised that
upon his ending she said nothing, made
no comment, seemed but sparingly interested,
although she listened with attention.
At last he thought best to volunteer
something.

(i I am afraid," he said, " that although
we may be able to corroborate every word
of Mr. Blake's, as far as facts are concerned,

ilia hypothesis will not have much influence
with the jury."

Why ? "

"Did you know Mr. Blake got money
from Mr. Davenport on the very night of
the 17th?"

In the darkness of the carriage here,
he was free from the spell of her
beauty, and spoke in a purely professional
tone.

"I did," she answered. "Mr. Blake
told me."

That admission took me by surprise.
It would greatly facilitate the discharge
of my duty towards you if you would
even now take me a little more fully into
your confidence."

There is nothing farther to tell —
nothing further to conceal," she said, ina
slow, emotionless voice.

He threw himself back, and did not

speak at once. At length he moved
uneasily in his place, and said, after
deliberation :

I appealed to you once, and cautioned
you several times. I may now tell you,
as a matter of certainty, not as a matter
of my own personal opinion, but of
ascertained fact, that the theory of what
I must now call the defence will not
stand a trial, and that a trial there will be."

I have nothing to add," she said, in
an unmoved tone.

Up to this I have not told you the
most unpleasant, the most significant and
alarming fact of all."

What is that ? " — in the same voice.

"I hope you will try and face the
horrible position with fortitude. I spoke
of a trial as now inevitable."

You mean something more than this
inquest ? " — in the same tone, but a little
more deliberately.

"Yes. This is only an inquiry into
the place, time, and cause of death. No
one is on trial for a crime as yet."

"You mean" — without any variation in
accent — " that some one will be tried for
the murder of my late husband ? "

He was silent.

She put her next question in a perfectly
old and steady manner :

"You mean that I will be tried for the
murder of my late husband ? "

Great heavens — no ! " he cried, throwing
himself forward with a violent start.
Who put such a monstrous thought
into your head ? "

Although the thought had frequently
occurred to him, from her lips, and now,
it came to him with a powerful shock.

"You."

I — I put such a thought into your
head ! Mrs. Davenport, you cannot mean
what you say ? It is too dreadful ! "

I will not say you ever put the thought
in as precise words as I have used ; but
at our first meeting it was in your mind,
and at our first meeting it entered my
mind that you considered it at all events
possible that I might be tried for the
murder of my husband. You need not
be afraid of shocking me. Nothing can
shock me now. What is the important
fact you are keeping back ? I wish to
know it at once."

Mr. Blake has been arrested this
evening:. He was arrested as he left the
'Wolfdog Inn'"

Is that all ? "

All ! Why, it is a matter of life and
death with him, as things now look. He
must have been mad to give the evidence
he did to-day."

And when am I to be arrested ? Or
perhaps I am already arrested, and the
driver is a policeman ? "

No, no. Nor is there, as far as I can
see, a likelihood of anything so horrible
taking place."

Neither the trial nor the scaffold would
have the least horror for me now, I shall
be ready for my death when they are
ready for it. This is my place — for the
present, at all events."

They had arrived in Jermyn Street,
and she alighted.

THE Verdict.

It was a strange room, large and bright and
fresh. The air of it was cool without being
cold. After all, was it a strange room ?
Had he not seen it, or something like it,
before ! But perhaps it was in a dream
he had seen that other room. A dream ?
Much of what had been resembled a dream.
Did not all the past look like a dream ?
How was one to know whether the past
had been dream or reality ? He could
not say. At all events, he was too tired
to decide any difficult question. He would
go to sleep now — at least he would shut

his eyes. That bright, cold glitter of
winter sunlight pained his eyes.

If before falling asleep, and while his
eyes were thus closed and his body at
rest, he could get a drink of cool, sweet
water, how deliciously refreshing it would
be!

How hot he was ! It wasn't an agreeable
kind of heat, but a dull, dead,
smouldering heat that parched his skin,
his tongue, his bones, his marrow.

Why, it was hotter than it had been
last night on the road !

On the road ! Last night ! What did
all that mean ? Oh, he was too tired to
think any more. Let him try to rest —
to sleep.

Dusk. Yes, there could be no doubt
the daylight was fading. At this time
of the year the days were short. He
had been asleep some time, for the last
thing he remembered was that it was

full daylight. He was then in some
difficulty as to this room. He was under
the impression it was a strange room.
Could a more absurd idea enter the mind of
man ? Is it possible he could not identify
his own bed-room ? What would come
next ? What should he forget next t
His own name, no doubt.

The thirst continued. It was even
greater than it had been. He could
get water if he went to the dressing-table.
But, strange as it might seem, he
had the greatest desire to go to the table
and drink the water, but not the will.
How was that ? Why did he not spring
out of bed and quench his thirst?

It was easy to think of springing out
of bed, but quite impossible to do anything
of the kind. Why, he could not
move his feet or hands with ease. Ah,
yes, it was quite plain ! He had been
ill — very ill. That would account for

all — for the confusion in awaking, the
thirst, the weakness. How long had he
been ill, and what had ailed him ?

This thirst was no longer tolerable. He
must drink.

Water ! "

How thin and weak his voice sounded !
It was almost ridiculous. If anything
could ever again be ridiculous, his voice
was. But nothing could ever again be
ridiculous. Everything was serious and
dull, and would so continue from that
time forward. It was strange no one
came. If he had been ill they would
hardly leave him alone. He must try
again.

Water ! "

Instantly a figure stood between his eyes
and the fading light in the window.

"You are better, Alfred?"

"Yes, Madge. Water."

His sister poured out some, and handed

VOL. 1. Q

him the glass. He drank with avidity,,
and felt refreshed.

I have been very ill, Madge ? "

Yes, Alfred ; but you will be all right
in a short time, now that you have begun
to mend. So Dr. Santley says."

Dr. Santley ! Ah, that name set memory
afoot. He lay pondering, still unable to
see distinctly the matters he wished.

How long have I been ill, Madge \ "

Several days."

I have been unconscious ? "

Yes. But you are sure to be quite
well in a little time."

"I am not anxious about the future.
I am trying to recall the past."

"You are not to speak much, and you
are on no account to excite yourself."

I must be in possession of the facts
of the past before I can rest. Tell me
what has happened — what happened just

"before I fell ill ? I have had fever, and
been delirious. "

You have ; but you must keep quiet,
or I shall go away."

I must know what took place before
my illness, if I am to be at ease. There
was some trouble about the law — some
inquiry. What was it ? "

Dr. Santley has forbidden me to speak
of that matter. You have been very ill,
and your recovery depends on your keeping
from excitement."

I must know. I shall become delirious
again if you do not tell me."

My dear, dear Alfred, I cannot — I must
not. You don t fancy for a moment I
am going to help you back into illness !
You shall know all in a little time ; and
now I must run away and tell father
and mother and Edith of the good change
in you."

Q 2

"Send Edith to me, or mother. Either
will tell me."

"You are not to see any one but me
to clay until Dr. Santley comes. There's
a dear fellow — rest content until I come
back to you. Already you have talked
too much."

She left the room in spite of his cry
of protest and entreaty.

In a slow, hopeless, helpless way his mind
began working again. Little by little some
figures of the past reappeared, but not the
central one, the main incident. He knew
an event of eminent unpleasantness had
occurred, and he knew it did not concern
any member of his own family. He knew
it did not concern himself closely, and yet
that he had a profound interest in it.
Santley was mixed up with it in one
way or another, but how he could not
tell. The law had been invoked ; but in
what manner or in whose regard was

concealed from him. He had a faint
memory of a crowded room. Only one
figure stood out boldly, and that Tom
Blake's. He knew his name, and could
describe him with minute accuracy ; but
why this man and his name were so
clearly defined in his recollection he could
not tell. Around Blake shone a fierce
light ; but whence it came or why it was
there he could not say. He felt Blake
had to do with the legal matter ; but in
what relation or capacity he could not
determine.

At length he resolved to give up trying
to solve the riddle, and to go to sleep
again. It seemed better to go asleep and
forget everything than to lie awake remembering
imperfectly.

A shaded lamp was burning in the room
when he again awoke. His mind was
now more vigorous and clear. Still there
was great confusion and uncertainty. He

called, and his sister Madge got up and
came to him with a basin of arrowroot.
She told him that Dr. Santley had called
and seen him while he slept, and that
he was going on very well indeed, but
that there was no use in his asking
questions ; and, in fact, that he was not
to talk at all, but rest perfectly quiet,
take his food and go to sleep again —
sleep and food being his chief needs now.

Young Paulton protested and expostulated,
but in vain ; so he was left in
the same state of vague uncertainty which
he was in when he awoke.

Next morning, as soon as he opened his
eyes, all that had been lost came back to
him in a flash. Nothing was wanting.
The repose of the night and the food had
invigorated his brain, and allowed it to
fill in the gaps which existed the night
before.

Madge was not in the room when he

awoke. The moment she came back he
said :

My memory was quite cloudy yesterday
; it is as clear as ever it was to-day.
I now remember everything. I can recall
my walk in the rain. How long have I
been ill ? "

"This is the sixth day."

"The sixth day! Good heavens! Six
days ! Then the inquest is over ? "

"Yes. You must not talk much or
excite yourself at all. You may, however,
talk a little more than yesterday, for you
are getting on famously.' '

"For goodness' sake, tell me about the
inquest, and don't talk of me and my
health. No, I won't taste breakfast until
you tell me. What was the verdict ? "

"Dr. Santley said you might be
answered questions to-day if you promised
not to excite yourself. Do you promise
to keep calm, Alfred ? "

Oh, yes. Go on."

"The verdict was that he committed
suicide while of unsound mind."

Suicide while of unsound mind ! Are
you sure ? "

Oh, perfectly."

Does Santley know the verdict ? "

Of course."

And what does he say ? "

That it is the most extraordinary case
he ever read or heard of."

JERRY O'BRIEN'S PROPHECY.

When Dr. Santley called that day, he
found his patient in a state of agitation.
Madge Paulton had given her brother an
outline of the proceedings at the second
sitting of the inquest; but she could not
tell him all, and she considered it would
be injudicious, to say the least of it, to
read a report of the trial aloud to him
until she got permission from the doctor.
Besides, the report was gruesome and
full of technicalities.

No sooner had Dr. Santley entered
the sick room than Alfred began a string

of impatient and somewhat incoherent
questions; so Santley thought it better
to allay the excitement at the expense
of a little fatigue to his patient, still he
absolutely forbade the long report to be
read to him.

"But," said the doctor, "there is a
leading article in the paper, and the
middle paragraph of that gives briefly an
account of the case from the point at
which the enthralling interest begins. You
may read that aloud to your brother,
Miss Paulton, and then T insist upon his
remaining almost silent for the remainder
of the day."

When Santley was gone, Madge fetched
the newspaper, and read aloud :

"We now reach the most extraordinary
point in this extraordinary case. The
evidence here is sufficient to convince
the most incredulous. Beyond all doubt,
when Mr. Blake left the house there was

nothing unusual the matter with the
deceased unfortunate gentleman. After
that it would seem that he must have
had an attack of the old mania respecting
which Mr. Blake gave evidence.
While under this morbid influence he
must have conceived the idea of committing
suicide, for he wrote on one
leaf of his pocket-book these words :

C I will not endure this any longer.
They have conspired to rob and murder
me. But I will evade them for good. In
ten seconds more I shall empty the chloroform
on my beard. In twenty minutes
I shall be dead. — Louis Davenport

"This is unmistakably in the handwriting
of the deceased. The piece of paper on
which it is written corresponds with a
blank in Mr. Davenport's pocket-book.
The writing was done with a metal pencil,
and the paper is remarkably tough. When
he had finished the writing, he carried

out his threat of spilling the chloroform-over
his beard and waistcoat. Between
this and the time during which the drug
began to exercise its fatal influence he
must have changed his mind, not, indeed,
as regards suicide, but as regards his
confession ; for he swallowed the piece
of paper on which the confession was
written, and wrote on another leaf in-the
same book these words :

"pretended death. Blake gone. Her
emptied chloroform on me. Cant stir
Dying'

"At the post-mortem examination the
former paper was produced. It had been
masticated and swallowed. The other leaf
of the pocket-book had been found in the
waistcoat-pocket of deceased. The certainty
of the former leaf having been
written first rests on the fact that the-latter

leaf has on it a faint but sufficient
trace of the writing on the former, the
degree of force used in writing the longer
communication being sufficient to mark
the leaf following. The post - mortem
clearly proved that chloroform was the
cause of death."

This was astonishing news. By it not
only was all shadow of suspicion removed
from Mrs. Davenport, but Blake was vindicated.
The stories told by Mrs. Davenport
and Blake had been confirmed in
the most amazing and unexpected manner.
It seemed little short, if at all short, of a
miracle. This strange account of deceased's
mental illness in Florence was true. Who
placed any value whatever on it when it
was given by Blake on oath ? It then
seemed nothing better than an audacious
and unnecessary lie. It had turned Alfred
sick while he listened to it. As he heard
that self-possessed, aggressive man give

evidence, be felt the toils closing round
the unhappy woman. Now, in all likelihood,
these toils had for ever vanished
into air, and Mrs. Davenport was as free
from suspicion of complicity in her husband's
murder as though the two had never
in all their lives met.

He asked his sister if she knew anything
about Mrs. Davenport. Madge had
an idea that Mrs. Davenport was still
staying at Jermyn Street. Young Paulton
asked nothing about Blake. He was not
concerned about him.

It was very hard to be obliged to lie

inactive here while He paused

to think. While what ? That question
staggered him. The interest in the inquest
was all over, and no other trial was
likely to arise out of the matter. Accident
had for a while connected him with
some affairs of Mrs. Davenport, and now
that accident was at an end. There was no

longer any chance of his being of use to
her. Nothing could be more natural than
that she had forgotten him by this time.
In the excitement and heat of that ordeal
there was nothing more likely than that
she should forget him absolutely.

But the case was different with him.
He could not forget her. He could never
forget her — no, not if he lived a hundred
years. Were they destined to meet never
again ? That was a dreary question to ask
and have to leave un answered, while he lay
weak and powerless here.

He should get well no doubt in time,
but this in time was such a weary, dead,
tedious thing. It would be infinitely depressing
and irksome to have to live here
day after day pulling up strength. How
was it possible for him to recover if
his mind were haunted by doubts and
anxieties ?

Doubts about what ? Anxieties about

whom ? He was not in love with this
woman. The notion of being in love with
her was absurd. He had seen her but on
three occasions, and then the meetings had
been brief and full of anything but tenderness.
He had heard and thought much of
her in the few days since their first meeting.
He should never forget their first
meeting. Could he ever blot out from his
memory the regal beauty and pose of her
as she stood in that dreary hall and pointed
out the room in which her husband lay
dead ? Ah, well, nothing could come of
such thinking now !

He wondered where was Blake at this
moment, while he lay there on his back
looking at the thin light of the February
day. However, there was nothing for it
but to submit. He was too weak to stand.
He must try and rest contented for a while.
But Dr. Santley did not think he would be
able to move about for a month, and even

then not much, as the weather would be
greatly against him.

He was this day allowed to see his
family for a little while. Before his father
left the room he had got his promise
to call at Jermyn Street and make inquiries.
Next evening his father came
up to his room. He had called at Jermyn
Street, and seen Mrs. Davenport. She
was quite well : was sorry to hear Alfred
had been ill. Mr. Prince had told her.
Her plans were not quite settled, but she
thought she should leave London for the
Continent in a few days. She did not
say what part of the Continent she purposed
going to. That was all.

The person outside the family whom
Alfred wished to see first was Jerry
O'Brien ; and, for reasons of friendliness
towards Alfred, and of something a good
deal more than friendliness towards Madge
Paulton, Jerry was not slow to come.

VOL. I. R

The younger Paultons were not remarkable
for beauty. The father was much
better-looking than the son — the mother
than either of the daughters. Father and
mother were both decidedly good-looking.
Alfred was of the average size of man,
upright, well-made, healthy-looking when
in health, fresh-coloured, with light hair
and beard touched here and there with
red, full blue eyes, long nose, white, broad
forehead, and useful, large, well-formed
hands. He was good-tempered, easygoing,
affectionate ; but when once roused
or awakened, he was impetuous, headlong,
and anything but clear-headed.

Edith, the elder sister, was short, plump,
saucy, often pert, blue-eyed, brown-haired,
resolute, aggressive at times, sprightly,
short-nosed, with small feet and hands,
and no mean opinion of herself, inclined
to be discontented, and to under-estimate
others.

Madge was tall, thin, dull-complexioned,
quiet, unselfish, undemonstrative, good-natured,
brown-eyed, and not good-looking
by any means. Her amiability was extraordinary,
her sympathy vast. Jerry
O'Brien was not a lady's man. He held
that sort of person in contempt. But of
one thing he was quite sure — that he was
disposed, anxious, to be one lady's man,
and that lady was Madge Paulton.

As soon as Alfred and Jerry were alone,
the former began making inquiries about
Mrs. Davenport.

She's in Jermyn Street yet," said Jerry.
I saw her this morning as I came along.
I don't think they have let Blake out of
gaol yet. It's a pity they ever should
do so. I don't think there could be any
act of Christian charity more acceptable
to heaven than to hang him. I'd do it
myself with pleasure if I could manage it
without touching the blackguard's neck.

The gallows never lost such a chance as
this was. Why, during the first day of
the inquest I could hear them knocking
the nails into a gibbet, and now, or in a
day or two, he will be a free man. It's a
horrible shame ! "

I don t care about him. I want to
hear something of her."

"Oh, you do — do you ? Not quite
cured yet. Well, I'll tell you my opinion.
She has announced her intention of going
to the Continent. She will wait until
he is discharged, and then be off with

him Alfred, what's the matter ? He

has fainted ! "

SALMON AND COWS.

Luncheon that day at Carlingford House
was a quiet, subdued meal. Edith Paul-ton,
who was very small and vivacious,
better-looking than Madge, and distinguished
by shrewd discontent rather
than the amiability which radiated from
her elder sister, was the only one at
the table that made an effort at being
sprightly. Although she was not unsympathetic,
she had a much more keen
appreciation of her own annoyances and
troubles than those of others. She took
great liberties with her good - natured

VOL. III. B

father and mother, and treated her
brother as if he were a useless compound
of slave, fool, and magnanimous
mastiff. She was by no means wanting
in affection, but she hated displays of
sentiment, and felt desperately inclined
to laugh on grave occasions.

That day, when the two girls left the
back room, they went straight to Madge's,
where they talked over the arrival of
Jerry O'Brien, for whom Edith strongly
suspected Madge had a warmer feeling
than friendship, and who, she felt morally
certain, greatly to her secret delight, was
over head and ears in love with Madge.
The only human being in whom she had
infinite faith was Madge. She did not
consider any hero or conqueror of history
good enough for her sister. To her
mind, there was only one flaw in Madge :
Madge would not worship Madge. Madge
thought every one else in the world of

consequence but herself. Edith thought
Madge the only absolutely perfect person
living, or that ever had lived — leaving
out, of course, the important defect just
mentioned. The younger girl had, inhuman
affairs, a certain hardness and
common-sense plainness which shocked the
more sensitive sister. For instance, she
could not see anything at all pathetic in
Mrs. Davenport's situation.

Before the bell rang for luncheon, she
said to her sister :

''I can't for the life of me see what
is so terribly melancholy in Mrs. Davenport's
case. I think she got out of it
rather well. She didn't care anything for
that dreadful old man who poisoned himself
out of some horrid kind of spite. She
hasn't been put in prison, and he left hera
whole lot of money. So that as she
isn't exactly an old maid, or a grandmother,
she can marry any other horrid old man

B 2

she likes. Oh, yes ; I know she's very-beautiful,
and what you call young, Madge.
She's not fifty yet, I suppose. Every
woman is young now until she's forty of
fifty ; and as to men, they don't seem to
grow old now at any age. As long asa
man doesn't use crutches, they say he
is in the full vigour of manhood — that
he's not marriageable until he's gray, and
bald, and deaf of one ear, or can't read
even with glasses. I suppose father will
make her stop for dinner. I thought I'd
laugh outright when I saw him go to
her and call her * child.' Child ! Fancy
calling a widow child ! If ever he calls
me child again, I'll tell him, as far as I
know, I have not buried any husband yet.
But, Madge, if she does stop for dinner,
I'm not going to sit there and learn the
very latest thing in the manners of widows.
I'll go out for a walk after luncheon. Do
you know, I think Jerry O'Brien is half

in love with this beautiful widow ! I'll
ask him to come with me, I will ; and you,
good-natured fool, may sit within and catch
the airs and graces of early widowhood,
though I don't think they'll ever be of any
use to you. You're certain to die an old
maid. Alfred can't keep his eyes off her.
It's a pity we haven't that nice Mr. Blake
here — her old sweetheart. There, Madge,
I don't mean a word I say, especially about
Jerry O'Brien. I know he's madly in love
with me. I'm going to give him a chance
of proposing this evening. We'll walk as
far as the Palace, and if you get separated
from us, and see me holding my umbrella
out from my side on two fingers — this
way — just don't come near us, and you
shall be my bridesmaid, and Jerry shall
give you a present of a bracelet representing
a brazen widow sitting on a
silver salmon. There's the bell! Madge,
love, I'm not a beast, only a brute.

There ! — I won't be rude again, and Fll
try and rather like Mrs. Davenport.
She'll be a neighbour of mine, you
know, when I'm married to Jerry. I
think I'll call him Fer then."

After luncheon, Mrs. Paulton suggested
that Mrs. Davenport should lie down, as
she must be quite worn out. But the
latter would not consent to this. She
said she felt quite refreshed, and in no
need of rest, as she had slept well the
previous night — although some memory
of the Channel passage was in her brain,
and the sound of the railway journey in
her ears.

The evening was fine. Neither Mrs.
Davenport nor Alfred cared for a walk
when it was suggested by Edith, but
Jerry said he would like it of all things ;.
so he and the two sisters set off down
the fine, broad, prosperous-looking Dulwich
Road, in the direction of the Crystal Palace.

It is proverbially a small world, and
the three pedestrians had not gone many-hundred
yards when whom should they
see but Nellie Cahill, one of the firm
friends and confidantes of the Paulton
girls. Before the three came up with
Miss Cahill, Edith gave a brief and
graphic sketch of her to Jerry, who had
not had the pleasure of meeting her
before. She was good-looking, good-humoured,
jolly, a dear old thing, mad
as a March hare, true as steel, and last,
though not least, interesting to him — a
fellow country-woman of his, as her name
betokened.

He must be introduced to her. He
.must like her awfully. He must love
her, if it came to that, unless, indeed,
that slow coach Alfred had been before
him — in which case he, Jerry, was to be
exceedingly obliging and deferential ; for
any one would rather have a nice girl

like Nellie for a sister - in - law titan a
thousand widows.

Jerry was duly introduced, and said civil
things and silly things, and the four walked
on all abreast, until Edith suddenly remembered
that she had to tell Nellie all about
the reappearance of Mrs. Davenport, and
a lot of other matters, in which two
sober, steady-going, middle-aged people
like Madge and Jerry could, by no stress
of imagination, be supposed to take a
sensible and hilarious interest. So the
younger division of the party, comprised
of Nellie Cahill and Edith Paulton, fell
to the rear, and the other division kept
the front. And thus, in spite of all Edith's
designs on Jerry both for herself and Nellie,
these two enterprising and eminently desirable
and lovable young ladies lost all
chance of his offering marriage to either
that afternoon.

A long story of the detestable villainy

of the Fishery Commissioners had to be
first and foremost related to Madge. Considering
that she did not know what a weir
was, and had never seen a salmon except
on the table or the marble slab of a fish-shop,
and that according to her notion
the appearance of a Commissioner was something
between a beef eater of the Tower
of London and a Brighton boatman, she
listened with great patience, and made
remarks which caused Jerry to laugh sometimes,
and plunge into profound technicalities
at others. But it became quite plain
that Jerry himself did not take any consuming
interest in his own wrongs and
the refined ruffianism of the Commissioners ;
for at a most bewildering description of the
channel, and the draught of water, and the set
of tides, and the idiosyncrasies of coal barges,
he looked over his shoulder and, finding Edith
and her friend a good way behind, stopped
suddenly in his discourse and said :

"Madge, I've been reeling off a lot of
rubbish to you just to drop the others a
good bit astern. I now want to say something
very serious to you. Are you listening?"



'eyes; but look at that cow! Did you
ever see a more contented-looking creature
in all your life ? "

She kept her face turned towards the
hedge.

Confound the cow ! " he cried. " Do
you think I am going to give up talking
of Bawn salmon and barges, and talk about
Dulwich cows ? Are you listening ? "

''I am. But did you — now — did you
ever see such a lovely cow ? "

*' Look here, Madge : If this is reprisal
for my harangue about my miserable
salmon weirs, I'll not say another word
about them. Are you going to be friends
with me ? "

'* Yes — of course."

Still the cow occupied her eyes, to judge
by the way her head was turned.

I came out expressly to have a most
serious talk with you on a most important
matter "

I am sure I was very sorry to hear
about your salmon nets "

Nets ! Nets ! Good heavens, Madge !
I never said a word about nets the
whole time. I'm not a cot-man. Look
here : you know it's only a few of the
greatest minds that can attend to two
things at the one time. You can't give
your soul to fish and yet devote yourself
to cows at the one moment, except
you are a person like Julius Caesar. He
could dictate and write completely different
things at the one time."

Could he ? He must have been very
clever."

Will you give up the cow ? I want
to talk of another beast."

"Trout?"

''No, not trout. Trout isn't a beast.
If you're clever and smart, and that kind
of thing, I won't talk about mj beast."

'' What is your beast ? "

"A fool."

"Oh!"

Are you not curious to know who
the fool is?"

"There are so many, one cannot be
interested in all."

No ; but you are interested in this one."

Silence.

I say you are interested in Alfred."

"Alfred!" She looked quickly round
for the first time since the cow had
attracted her attention. Her colour was
vivid, and her breath came short. " Alfred
a fool ! "

"Yes; he's hit— badly hit."

You don't think him ill ? " — in alarm.
The colour faded quickly.

I think him very bad."

His brain again. Oh, do tell me ! "
pleadingly.

"No. He told me all in the front
room to-day. It's his heart this time."

"His heart?"

"Yes. Love."

Love ! In love with whom ? "

"I forget."

You forget whom he is in love
with ? "

"Yes. Another matter has put it out
of my head. Madge, Tm a fool too.
You needn't turn away. There are no
more cows, Madge. Give up the salmon
and cows, Madge, and have me instead!
Will you, Madge ? Give me your hand.
. . Thank you, love. Madge ! "

"Yes."

"The other two have turned back.
There is no one else in the road. May
I kiss you ? "

She looked over her shoulder on the
side away from him. Then she looked
at him. . . .

"Thank you, darling. Let us turn
hack. I have touched the limits of my
happiest road. Madge ! "

'* Yes."

"Yes, Jerry. Say *Yes, Jerry'"

Yes, Jerry."

"That's better. I won't kiss you again
until we get into the house. Do you
think you can last out till then ? "

I — I think so, Jerry."
^ " That's right. Cultivate self - denial
and obedience. You don't think it is
respectable for a man to kiss his sweetheart
on a public road ? "

"No."

That's right. Cultivate self-denial and
obedience, but chiefly obedience. Don't
you think it is the duty of woman to cultivate
obedience chiefly ? "

'' I do."

"And if I asked it, you would, out of
obedience to me, trample self-denial underfoot?"


Certainly, Jerry, if you wished it'*

I do. Oh, my Madge — my darling —
my gentle love ! Once more."

But Edith has turned round and sees
us. . . . And my hat — you have knocked
off my hat. . . . Thanks. Now pick up
my hair-pin. It fell with the hat. What
will Edith think ? "

ni tell her. I'll tell Edith quite plainly
it was your self-restraint gave way, not
mine."

A FORTUNE LOST.

That day settled many things. Alfred had
told O'Brien that no matter how unwise or
rash it might seem, he had made up his
mind to try his fate with Mrs. Davenport —
not, of course, at that time, perhaps not
very soon, but ultimately, and as soon as
possible.

Until that day — until he had seen her
moved by the sense of her own loneliness,
until he had seen the tears start into her
eyes — he had not said even to himself that
he loved her. He told himself over andover
again that he would risk his prospects,

his life, his honour for her. How his prospects
or life could be imperilled he did not
know, did not care. He had a modest
fortune of his own, and her husband had
left her the bulk of his great wealth. He
would have preferred her poor rather than
rich. But if she would marry him, he
would not allow the fact that she had
money to stand in the way of his happiness.
She had for a while, owing to circumstances
in which no blame attached to
her, found herself labouring under a hideous
suspicion. From the shadow of that suspicion
she had emerged without blemish.
She had been cruelly ill-used by fate, but it
had been shown she was blameless. Where,
then, could danger to his honour lie ?
Her beauty was undeniable ; her family
unexceptionable. She had been sold to an
old man by a venal lover. In this lurked
no disgrace to her. What could his father
or mother find in her to object to ? Nothing

VOL. III.

absolutely nothing. That day his father
and mother showed great pleasure in seeing
her again. His father had suggested — nay,
arranged — that he should accompany heron
that long journey to Ireland.

When Jerry O'Brien left Carlingford House
that afternoon, he had no intention of
asking Madge to be his wife. All the way
from Kilbarry to London he had been assuring
himself that nothing could be more
injudicious than to say anything to her on
the subject at present. He believed she was
not indifferent to him. Little actions and
words of hers had given him cause to hope.
He was sure she preferred him to any other
man in whose society he had ever seen her.
She had smiled and coloured at his approach,
and once or twice, when he had ventured to
press her hand, he had suffered no reproach
by word or look. All this made it only the
more necessary for him to be on guard and
not allow himself to be betrayed into a

declaration until his affairs were settled.
But the opportunity came, and he could
not resist the temptation of telling her he
loved her, and of hearing from her that he
was loved by her. It is true no word had
been said between them of an engagement
even. The mere formality of speech was
nothing. Practically he had asked her to
be his wife, and she had plainly given him
to understand she was willing to marry
him.

Madge got back to the house in a state
of bewildered excitement. She confided
nothing to her sister, and Edith behaved
very well, never showing even a trace
of curiosity or slyness. She persisted in
talking of the most everyday topic. She
wondered whether Miss Grant, the dressmaker,
would keep her word ? — whether
this would be as bad a year for roses as
last ? She was of opinion the cold weather
would not return. Nellie Cahill had told

c 2

her the new play at the Ben Jonson was
a complete failure, in spite of all said to
the contrary, and so son. Madge replied
in monosyllables or vacant laughs. When
the girls got home, each went to her own
room, and they did not meet again until
dinner time. Madge decided she had no
occasion to speak to her mother, or anyone
else, about what occurred on the
Dulwich Road. It would be time enough
to speak when Jerry said something more
definite to her, or when either her father
or mother spoke to her.

Jerry sought Alfred, whom he found
alone in the library. He had been carried
beyond himself that afternoon, and did
not feel in the position to administer to
his friend a lecture on prudence. Alfred
was of full age, and, in the way of money,
independent of his father. Let him do
as he pleased and take his chance, as any
other man must in similar circumstances.

He himself, for instance, would take advice
in his love affair from neither Fishery
Commissioners nor John O'Hanlon.

'' How far did you go ? " asked Alfred,
who looked flushed, radiant. He got up
and began walking slowly about the room*'

Oh, a little beyond the College. It
isn't a very pleasant day out of doors.
We met an old flame of yours — Miss
Cahill."

Miss Cahill an old flame of mine !
Why, I never was more than civil to the
girl in all my life ! Who invented that
story for you ? "

**I don't think it was pure invention.
Edith mentioned it to us."

' To us ! ' Good heavens, you don't
mean to say she said anything of the kind
in Miss Cahill's presence?"

Well, no — not exactly in her presence,
but when she was near us. How did you
get on since ? "

Jerry's object was to keep the conversation
in his own hands, and prevent Alfred
asking questions. To-morrow, when they
were both clear of London, he might take
his friend into his confidence, but not
now.

*'0h, dully enough," answered Alfred,
with a look of disappointment. "My
father went out, my mother is busy about
the house, and Mrs. Davenport is in her
room. She will, I hope, be able to comedown
to dinner. You don't think, Jerry,"
he asked, anxiously, while he paused before
his friend, 'that her health has suffered
by all she has gone through ? "

No ; but I am quite sure your peace
of mind has," replied Jerry, with a dry
smile.

With all his desire to be conciliatory,
he could not wholly curb his tongue.

"I," laughed the other, 'was never

happier in all my life. Why, only to
think that she is under this roof now,
and that we are going on a long journey
with her tomorrow, and that I am to
be near her for a whole month ! It's too
good to be true."

I hope not."

"Well, Jerry, I hope not too; but it
seems too good. I know you are one of
those men who never give way to their
feelings until they know exactly whither
their feelings are taking them. It isn't
every one who has such complete self-command
as you. I am willing to risk
everything in the world for a woman.
Some men are too cautious to risk anything."


*' There's a good deal of truth and a
good deal of rubbish in what you say,"
rejoined Jerry, colouring slightly, and
concealing his face from his companion

by going to the window and looking out
at the evergreens and leafless trees in
the front garden.

Alfred's last speech had not been exactly
a chance shot. He more than guessed
Jerry cared a good deal for Madge ; but
the tone of the other had exasperated him,
and he made an effort to compel silence,
if not sympathy, from him. Jerry was
not prepared to retort. He did not want
to deny or assert his own susceptibility
to the unconscious arts of any woman ;
and, above all, he did not wish Madge's
name to be introduced even casually.

At last dinner came. It was an informal,
a substantial, cosy meal. No special preparations
had been made for the guests.
There was no display, no stint, no profusion.
Jerry sat beside Madge, and
Alfred between Edith and Mrs. Davenport.
Jerry was the most taciturn — Madge the
most demure of the party. Mr. Paulton.

was chatty, cordial, and particularly gracious
to the widow. Mrs. Davenport was
polite, impassable, absent-minded.

When they were waiting for the joint,
Mr. Paulton turned to Jerry, and said :

"Are you depressed at the prospect of
spending a while with an invalid ? To
look at you both, one would think it
was you, not Alfred, who wants change
of air."

"ind so it is," said Jerry, stealing a
look at Madge.

In order to divert attention from her,
for she felt her face growing hot, she
said :

*' I believe the south of Ireland is very
mild?"

'* Oh, very ! " Jerry answered, with
startling vivacity. " It's the mildest climate
in the world ; but the people are
not particularly mild : they are full of
fire and fight. I have no doubt Alfred

will come back a regular Milesian. You
know those who live a while in Ireland
always become more Irish than the Irish."

'never mind," said Mrs. Paulton. ''He
may become as Irish as he likes if he at
the same time grows as well in health as
we like."

I intend coming back quite a Goliath,
mother. I shall eat and drink everything
I see," said Alfred gaily.

You would find some of the things
in the neighbourhood of Kilcash rather
hard to chew. I think Mrs. Davenport
will agree with me that it would take
Goliath a long time to make a comfortable
meal of the Black Rock, or to make a
comfortable meal on it ? "

At the name of the Rock, Mrs. Davenport
looked up and shuddered visibly, and
said, as she rested slightly on the back of
her chair :

"The Black Rock is a hideous place."

Then, turning to Alfred : " You must not
go there."

I am altogether in the hands of this
unprincipled wretch," answered Alfred,
smiling and nodding at Jerry.

Then," said Jerry, *' if you are not very
civil — if you show a disposition to exhibit
your Goliath-like prowess on me, I shall
take you to the Black Rock, and first
frighten the life out of you, and then
throw you into the Puffing Hole, where,
except you are the ghost of your own
grandfather, or something equally monstrous,
you will be promptly smashed into
ten billions of invisible atoms."

The rest of the dinner passed off" quietly.
When the dessert had been put on the table,
and the servants had withdrawn, Mr. Paul-ton
said :

Mr. O'Brien, I have often heard you
talk of this Black Rock and the Puffing
Hole, but I am afraid I never had the industry

to ask you for a description of
either. Are they very wonderful?"

There is nothing wonderful about the
Kock, except its extent and peculiar shape
and colour. But the Puffing Hole, although
not unique, is curious and terrible."

I am doubly interested in them now,
since I have the pleasure of numbering
Mrs. Davenport among my friends. What
are the Black Rock and Puffins: Hole
like ? " He smiled, and bent gallantly
towards the widow.

I think'* said Jerry, *' Mrs. Davenport
herself is the best person to give you a
description of either. Her house is near
them, and she has lived, I may say, next
door to them for years, and knows more
than I do of the place. To make the
matter even, if Mrs. Davenport will do the
description I will do the narrative part of
the tale. That is a fair division."

Mrs. Davenport trembled slightly again.

and was about to speak, when Mr. Paulton
said, in a tone of impetuous persuasion :

Your house near these strange freaks of
nature, Mrs. Davenport ! Of course I did
not know that, or I should not have
dreamed of asking Mr. O'Brien for an
account of them."

The old man's belief was that it
would divert Mrs. Davenport's mind from
wholly gloomy subjects if she were only
induced to speak of matters of general interest.


She shook her head sadly.

It is true my home was for many years
at Kilcash House, which is near the Black
Rock. But "

She paused, and a peculiar smile took
possession of her face. All eyes were fixed
on her in expectation. No one cared to
speak. What could that strange break
mean ? Surely, to describe a scene or
phenomenon of the coast with which she

was most familiar could not be very
distressing ?

But," she resumed, " it is my home no
longer. It is true I am going back there fora
little time — a few weeks ; but that is only
to arrange matters. I have now no home."

o

The voice of the woman was almost free
from emotion. It was slightly tremulous
towards the end ; but if she had been
reading aloud a passage she but dimly
understood, she could have displayed no
less emotion.

"No home ! — no home ! " said Mr. Paulton,
so softly as to be only just audible. " I
was under the impression you had been left
Kilcash House."

"Yes, my husband left me Kilcash
House and other things — other valuable
things — and a large sum of money.
But "

Again she paused at the ominous "but."

Again all were silent, and now even Mr.

Paulton could not light on words that
seemed likely to help the widow over her
hesitation.

"But I cannot take anything."

Once more the old man repeated her
words : ** Cannot take anything ! Are the
conditions so extraordinary — so onerous ? "

He and O'Brien thought that the principal
condition must be forfeiture in case
she married Blake. This would explain
much of what was now incomprehensible.

There are no conditions whatever in
the will," she said in the same unmoved
way.

"No conditions ! And yet you have no
home, although your late husband has left
you a fine house ?"

"Yes, and all that is necessary for the
maintenance of that house ; notwithstanding
which, I have no home, and am a
beggar."

Mrs. Davenport," cried the old man,

with genuine concern, "what you say is
very shocking. I hope it is not true."

*' I know this is not the time or place to
talk of business. I know my business can
have little or no interest for you."

Excuse me, my dear Mrs. Davenport,
there is nothing out of place about such
talk now, and you really must not say we
take but slight interest in your affairs. On
the contrary, we are very much interested
in them. I think I may answer for every
member of my family, and say that beyond
our own immediate circle of relatives there
is no lady in whom we take so deep an
interest."

The old man was solemn and emphatic.

I am sure," said Mrs. Paulton, looking
round the table, ** that my husband has
said nothing but the simple fact."

She turned her eyes upon the widow.

Mrs. Davenport, I hope you will
always allow me to be your friend. Your

troubles have, I know, been very great, and
you are now no doubt suffering so severely
that you think the whole world is against
you. We, at all events, are not. Anything
we can do for you we will ; and, believe me,
Mrs. Davenport, doing anything for you
will be a downright pleasure."

The widow bowed her head for a moment
before speaking. It seemed as though she
could not trust her voice. After a brief
pause she sat up, and, resting the tips of
the fingers of both hands on the table, said :

** As I told you earlier to-day, I have
been alone all my life, and the notion of
fellowship is terrible to me, coming now
upon me when my life is over."

'* Indeed you should not talk of your
life being over. You are still quite
young. Many a woman does not begin
her life until she is older than you."

I am thirty - four, and that is not
young for one to begin life."

VOL. III. D

*but, may I ask' said Mr. Paulton,
"how it is that the will becomes inoperative
? How is it that you cannot
avail yourself of your husband's bequests
? "

*'My reasons for not taking my husband's
money must, for the present — I
hope for ever — remain with myself. Mr.
Blake has told me certain things, and
I have found out others myself. I am
now without money — I do not mean''
she said, flushing slightly, 'for the present
moment, for a month or two — but
I am without any money on which I can
rely for my support. I shall have to
begin life again — or, rather, begin it for
the first time. I shall have to work for
my living, just as any other widow who
is left alone without provision. This is
very plain speaking, but the position is
simple."

But, my dear Mrs. Davenport, you

must not in this way give yourself upto
despair," said Mr. Paulton, as he rose
and stood beside her.

Despair ! " she cried, looking up at
him with a quick glance of angry surprise.
Despair ! You do not think me so poor
a coward as to despair. How can one who
never knew hope know despair ? I amin
no trouble about the future. I shall
take to a line of life in which there is room
and to spare for such as I."

Do not do anything hastily, I have a
good deal of influence left."

Mrs. Paulton, who saw that Mrs. Davenport
was excited, over wrought, rose and
moved towards the door. The others stood
up, excepting Mrs. Davenport, who, as she
was excited and looking up into Mr. Paul-ton's
face, did not hear the stir or seethe
move.

"I am most sincerely obliged to you,
Mr. Paulton, but I greatly fear that, much

D 2

as I know you would wish it, you could not
aid me in my business scheme."

May I ask what the business is ? "

The stage."

The stage, Mrs. Davenport ! You
astound me."

I have lived alone and secluded all
my life. For the future I shall, if I can,
live among thousands of people, whom I
will compel to sympathise with my mimic
trials, since I never had any one to sympathise
with my real ones. I shall flee
from an obscurity greater than a cloister's
to the blaze and full publicity of the footlights.
You think me mad ? "

'•' No ; ill-advised. Who suggested you
should do this ? "

She glanced around, and saw that the
ladies were waiting for her.

'' I beg your pardon," she said to them,
as she rose and walked towards the door,
which Alfred held open.

She turned back as she went out, and
answered Mr. Paulton's question with the
two words :

*^Mr. Blake."

Alfred closed the door. The three men
looked in amazement at one another.

"There's something devilish in her or
Blake," said the old man.

Or both," said Jerry O'Brien.

By a tremendous effort, Alfred Paulton
sat down and kept still. He did not say
anything aloud, but to himself he moaned :

'' If I lose her, my reason will go again —
this time for ever ! "

A TELEGRAM FROM THE MAIL.

When the men found themselves alone
and somewhat calmed down after the
excitement caused by Mrs. Davenport's
astonishing announcement, Mr. Paulton
and Jerry discussed the proposed step
with great minuteness and intelligence,
while Alfred sat mute and listless. He
pleaded the necessity of his going to bed
early on account of tomorrow's journey.
In the course of the discussion between
the two elder men, Jerry held that if she
did take to the stage, she would make
one of the most startling successes of the
time.

She has beauty enough," he said, " to
make men fools, and fire enough to make
them lunatics. What a Lady Macbeth
she would be ! "

Mr. Paulton was anything but a fogey.
He did not forget that he had been once
young, nor did he forget that, when young,
a pretty face and a fine figure had seemed
extremely bewitching things. He was
liberal in all his views, except in the
matter of betting. To that vice he would
give no quarter whatever. He never once
sought to restrain his son's reading, and
Alfred had a latchkey almost as soon ashe
was tall enough to reach the keyhole.
Although he did not smoke himself, he
saw no objection to others, his son included,
smoking in suitable places, and
with moderation. He did not exclude
shilling whist from his code, although he
never played. He rarely went out after
dinner now, but when he made his mind

up to move, he did not think there was
anything unbecoming in his visiting a
theatre — the front of a theatre, mind
you, sir. He supposed and believed there
were many excellent men behind the
scenes, and he did not feel himself called
upon to say that the majority of the
ladies were not all that could be
desired ; but — ah, well, he would be very
sorry — it would, in fact, break his heart
if either of his daughters — Madge, for
instance — went upon the stage.

With the latter part of this somewhat
long-winded speech Jerry heartily concurred.
He felt furious and full of strength
when he fancied Madge behind the curtain,
subjected to dictation and uncongenial
associations, not to speak of anything more
disagreeable still. There were nasty
draughts and nasty smells, and nasty
ropes and nasty dust, and sometimes the
carefully-attuned ear might catch a nasty

word. It was blasphemy to think of
Madge in such an atmosphere, amid such
surroundings. And then fancy any *' young
man " of fifty-six putting his arm round
Madge, and administering even a stage kiss
to his darling ! The thing was preposterous,
and not to be entertained by any
sane mind.

Coffee was sent into the dining-room,
and the whole household retired early.

Alfred's reflections that night were the
reverse of pleasant. He had that day
seen the woman he loved. She had
come before his eyes as unsought as the
flowery pageant of summer. She had
filled his heart with tropical heat, had
set fancy dancing in his head, and restored
strength and vigour to his invalid body.
He had, before the moment his eyes rested
on her that day, been satisfied with the
hope of seeing her in weeks, months. She
had come voluntarily, no doubt, without

special thought of him, to their home ;
she had once more accepted their hospitality,
and he and O'Brien were to
accompany her to Ireland. They would
not travel together, but he should know
she was near — know she was in the same
train, in the same steamboat ; they should
meet frequently on the journey, and,
crowning thought of all, they had one
common destination !

He had that day spent some delicious
minutes in her company. While she was
by he had forgotten his late illness, his
present weakness. The immediate moment
had been filled with incommunicable joy,
and the future with splendid happiness.

What had befallen all this dream of
enchantment ? Ruin — ruin complete and
irreparable ! She was, owing to some
secret and mysterious cause or other, no
longer rich. In her own estimation she
was a pauper. That was little. If that

was all, it could be borne with a smile
nay, with gratitude ; for riches would
act as a lure to other men, and he wanted
only herself and, if it might come in time,
her love.

She had determined to go upon the stage.
That was bad — entirely bad ; but if this
evil resolve stood alone, it might be combated.
If she had determined merely with
herself to follow the profession of an actress,
she might be persuaded to abandon her
design. But the unfortunate course she
had made up her mind to follow had been
suggested by Blake, by an old lover who
years ago was dear to her, and now was
absolute in her counsels. This put an
end to every hope that she could ever
be his.

Oh, weary day, and wearier night !

If he could, he would back out of going
to Ireland ; but that was now impossible.
Under the pressure of his great joy, he had

told O'Brien of his love for Mrs. Davenport,
and all arrangements had, at his request,
been made for their setting off tomorrow.
She must go tomorrow. While there is
life there is hope. He was hoping against
hope ; but accidents did happen in many
cases, and might happen in this one. No
man was bound to despair ; in fact, despair
was cowardly and unmanly. It was the
duty of every man to hope, and he would
hope. He would go to Ireland tomorrow ;
he would put his chance against Blake's.
If this disappointment were to kill him or
drive him mad, he might as well enjoy the
pleasure of being near her until his health
or mind gave way finally.

When he came to this decision he fell
asleep.

Next day broke chill and dismal, and
none of the folk at Carlingford House
seemed lively except Edith. Mrs. Paulton
was depressed because her only son was

going away from home and into a country
of which she had a vague and unfavourable
notion. O'Brien was sulky at the thought
of being torn from the side of Madge, now
that he might talk freely to her of love
and their prospects, and the brutal Commissioners.
Mrs. Davenport was depressed
by a variety of circumstances and considerations,
and Alfred had much to make
him anything but cheerful. Mr. Paulton's
seriousness — that was the strongest word
which could fairly be applied to his humour
was due to the dulness of the weather,
and a depreciation in the value of some
shares held by him.

During the day each of the travellers
was more or less busy with preparations.
Mrs. Davenport had to go to town early
in order to transact business she had
neglected the day before. Alfred stayed
mostly in his room, and O'Brien, far from
sweet-tempered, managed, through the unsought

contrivance of Edith, to be a whole
hour alone with Madge.

*you know," he said to her, when preliminaries
had been disposed of, "it's a
beastly nuisance to have to go away from
you now. I'd much rather stop, I assure

you."

*' You are very kind."

Don't be satirical, Madge. No woman
ever yet showed to advantage when satirical.
I say it's a great shame to have
to go away, particularly when it's only to
save appearances ; for now that Blake has
once more come on the scene, all is up
with poor Alfred. Upon my word, Madge,
I pity him."

'' Do you like her, Jerry ? "

"No. I like you. I like you very
much. You're not a humbug."

"Is she?"

"No. But she's too awfully serious. I
cannot help thinking she ought to do

everything to the slow music of kettledrums."


Why kettle-drums ? "

**I don't know. I suppose it's because
the concerted kettle-drum is the most bald
and arid form of harmonious row. Tm
afraid my language is neither select nor
expressive. But one can't help one's
feelings — particularly when one's feelings
make one like you. I really am sorry to
have to leave you."

"But you mustn't blame me for that."

"Now you are quite unreasonable. You
must know that a man without a grievance
is as insipid as a woman without vanity."

Jerry, I'm not a bit vain ; I never
was a bit vain. What could I be vain
about ? "

Ungrateful girl ! Have I not laid
my hand and fortune, including the bodies
of the murdered Commissioners, at your
feet?"

"You are silly, Jerry."

How am I silly ? In having laid my
hand and fortune and the bodies "

No. In talking such nonsense."

"And you are not vain of having made
a conquest of me ? "

Jerry, I'm very fond of you, and I
don't like you to talk to me as if you
thought I was only a silly girl whom you
were trying to amuse with any silly things
you could think of. I hope you don't
believe I'm a fool ? "

No. You are right, Madge : it's a poor
compliment for a man to talk mere tattle to
his sweetheart. I wonder, darling, if you
would give me a keepsake, now that I am
going away ? "

No. I have no Mth in keepsakes. I
would not take any keepsake from you,
because I shall need nothing to remind me
of you when you are away."

'darling, nor I of you. And if things
go wrong with me ? "

They can't go wrong with you."

"I mean if I come off worse in these
business affairs."

That will not make any difference
in you."

No. Nor in you, darling ? "

*'No."

He held her in his arms a while, and
said no more. Thus they parted.

It had been arranged that the two men
should meet Mrs. Davenport at Euston.
They were on the platform when she
arrived. To their surprise she was not
alone : Blake accompanied her. As soon as
they came forward he shook hands with
her, raised his hat, and retired.

O'Brien and Paulton were greatly taken
aback by Blake's presence. They busied
themselves about her luggage, and then

VOL. III. B

took seats in the same compartment with
her. They were the only passengers in the
compartment.

As soon as the train was in motion she
leaned forward to O'Brien, and said in a
clear, distinct voice, the edge of which
was not dulled by the rumble of the
wheels :

You arrived the day before yesterday
from Ireland?"

"Yes," he answered, bending forward and
looking into her inscrutable eyes.

You have been at Kilcash ? "

*' Yes. I was there for about a
month."

Did you hear a ghost story there ? "

He started and looked seriously at her.

Yes, I did. May I ask if you have
heard anything about it ? "

"Yes. When I got back to Jermyn
Street where I stayed, I found a letter
there telling me that a ghost, the ghost of a

man named Michael Fahey, had been seen
in the neighbourhood of Kilcash."

*sat the Black Rock. I was going to
tell the story yesterday at dinner, but it
slipped by."

*' Do you know anything of this —
apparition ? "

'' I saw it myself, and two others saw it."

Where do we stop first ? "

*eat Rugby."

She took a note-book from her pocket,
and wrote something in it. When the
writing was finished, she tore out the leaf
on which it was, and handed the leaf to
O'Brien, saying :

Will you be kind enough to telegraph
this from Rugby for me ? "

It will have to be written on a form,"
he said, hesitatingly.

"Will you oblige by writing it on a
form for me ? There is no reason why
you shouldn't read it."

E 2

ItRRARY

When lie got out at Rugby he read
the message. It was addressed to Blake,
and ran :

''Mr. O'Brien saw what I told you.
Follow me to Ireland at once."

THE TRAVELLERS.

It was impossible for O'Brien to tell
Alfred the nature of the telegram he had
just despatched to Blake. It would not
be seemly to whisper or to write, and to
leave the compartment with the proclaimed
intention of seeking a smoking carriage
would be a transparent device. There was
nothing for it but to sit still and keep
silent.

The three travellers settled themselves
in their corners, and pretended to goto
sleep. Each had thoughts of an
absorbing nature, but none had anything

exceptionally happy with which to beguile
the dreary midnight journey. It was impossible
to see if Mrs. Davenport slept
or not. She had, upon settling herself
after leaving Rugby, pulled down her thick
veil over her face, and remained quite
motionless. Young Paulton was not yet
as strong as he imagined, and the monotonous
sound and motion soon fatigued
him, and he fell asleep.

Although O'Brien kept his eyes resolutely
shut he never felt more wakeful
in his life.

What on earth could this woman want
with this man of most blemished reputation
and desperate fortune ? She had
seen him lately, and he had told her
something of the mysterious appearance
near the Puffing Hole ; but it was not
until after they had started from Euston
that she had made up her mind to summon
him to Ireland. What could she want

him for ? She was, according to her own
statement, now no longer rich. She was
no longer young. The best years of her
beauty had passed away. No doubt she
was still an extremely beautiful woman, but
the freshness was gone. As far as he knew,
Blake was the last man in the world to
marry such a woman. And yet there
was some secret bond, some concealed
link between them. He was not unjust
to her. He did not believe she would
inveigle any man into a marriage, and he
could not understand why this Blake was
now even tolerable to her.

However matters might go, it looked
as if Alfred were certain to suffer. It was
quite plain he was madly in love with
her, and that she did not see, or was
indifferent to his passion. She was nota
coquette. She showed no desire to
claim indulgence because of her sex or
sorrows, and certainly exacted no privilege

as a tribute to her beauty. To him she
seemed hard, mechanical, cold. She had,
it is true, broken down the day before,
but that was under extreme pressure.
Usually she was as unsympathetic, self-contained
as bronze.

Jerry was not a fool or a bigot, and he
allowed to himself, with perfect candour,
that although he looked on Alfred's passion
as infatuation, he could understand it. He
himself was no more in love with her
than with the black night through which
they were speeding ; but if she, at that
moment, raised her veil and stood before
him and bade him undertake something
unpleasant — nay, dangerous — he would
essay it. Strength gives command to a
man, beauty to a woman, love to either.

At Chester the three got coffee, and
once more took up their corners and
affected to sleep or slept.

When they reached the boat at Holyhead,

Mrs. Davenport said good-night and descended
to the ladies' cabin. The two
friends got on the bridge, and as soon
as the steamer had started O'Brien took
Paulton to the weather bulwark, and told
him the substance of the telegram Mrs.
Davenport had sent to London.

To O'Brien's astonishment, the younger
man made nothing of the matter. It
was simply a business affair, he said :
nothing of any moment. From all they
had heard, Blake knew more than they
had supposed of the dead man's affairs ;
and now that Mrs. Davenport had resolved
not to take the fortune her husband
had left her, it was almost certain Blake
could be of assistance to her.

After a little while it was agreed that
the bridge was too cold for Alfred, so both
men went below and lay down. O'Brien
fell asleep, and did not awake until he
was called close to Kingstown.

It was a dreary, cold, bleak morning,
with thin sunlight. There had been rain
in the night, and everything looked chill
and depressing. The passage had been
smooth, and none of the three had suffered
by it beyond the spiritless depression
arising from imperfect rest and fatigue.

When they alighted at Westland Now,
Jerry suggested that they should send on
their luggage to the King's Bridge terminus,
and seek breakfast.

*not my luggage," said Mrs. Davenport
; '' I am not going to Kilcash to-day.
Kindly get me a cab. I will stay at the
'Tourists' Hotel.' I have telegraphed, as
you know, to Mr. Blake to come over,
and will send him word to meet me there.
I am extremely obliged to both of you
for all your kindnesses on the way."

Alfred started, and Jerry looked surprised.


You are," the latter said, " quite sure

you prefer staying here. Of course I do
not presume to interfere ; but perhaps it
might be more convenient for you, Mrs.
Davenport, if Mr. Blake followed you to
Kilcash ? "

"I am quite sure," she said, decisively,
"that it would be best for me to stay in
Dublin for the present."

If you simply wanted rest, we could
wait for you a day or two," said Alfred,
out of whose face all look of animation
had gone.

*' Thank you, I am not in the least
tired ; and if you will get me a cab, and
tell the man to drive me to the ' Tourists,'
you will greatly oblige me."

Nothing more was to be done or said.
Her luggage was put on a cab, she again
thanked the two friends, and saying she
hoped to have an opportunity of soon
seeing them at Kilcash House, said goodbye
to them, and drove away.

Alfred and Jerry O'Brien got breakfast,
drove to the King's Bridge terminus, and
started for the South in no very good
humour.

It's always the way," thought the latter,
despondingly. '' Only for the infernal Commissioners
and O'Hanlon's craze about his
brain — bless the mark ! — I need not have
left London last month. Only for Alfred's
infatuated impatience and his father's vicarious
gallantry, I might be there now ;
and here are the Commissioners gone to
sleep, O'Hanlon's head good for nothing,
any number of future bills of costs,
and we deserted by the object of young
love and elderly gallantry ! Upon my
word, it's too bad. If O'Hanlon had only
had the good sense to murder the Commissioners
while suffering from temporary
or permanent insanity, and Blake owned
the good taste to run away with the widow
why, then, things would be wholesome

and comfortable. As it is, they are simply-beastly."


The two friends arrived late that night
at the '' Strand Hotel," Kilcash, and went
to bed almost immediately. Neither rose
early next morning, but when they did
get up, they found the weather magically
improved. A few high silver clouds floated
against the deep blue screen of sky, beyond
which one knew the stars lay ; for the
grass and bare branches of trees flashed
and blazed, not with the yellow light of
the gaudy sun, but with rays that seemed
glorious memories of midnight stars. The
sea in the bay was calm as a lake, and
joined upon the level margin of the sand
smoothly, like a steady white flame spreading
out from a dull red lake of fire. The
doors of the cottages were open, and people
were abroad. Thin wreaths of smoke went
up from hushed hearths. Hundreds of
gulls sailed slowly up and down across

the mouth of the bay. Now a dog barked,
now a cock crew, now a wild bird whistled.

Opposite Alfred, as he stood at his
window, drinking in the peace of the scene,
rose the sloping sides of the bay. On
them were sheep grazing. Here the salt
blasts from the Atlantic would let no wheat
or oats, or grain of any other kind, prosper.
Nothing would grow but short, poor grass,
on which sheep picked up an humble livelihood.
The harvest fields of Kilcash
were beyond the bay, out there on the
blue depths of the ocean, that great
cosmopolitan common of the races of
man.

Little labour was ever to be done in
Kilcash. Its farms, its workshops, its
mines were in the sea. No child, until
he himself went to sea, ever saw his father
work. The men came home not merely
to their houses, but to the village to rest.
When they had hauled up their boats,

and carried away the nets and sails and
oars and masts, their labours were at an
end. The women bore the fish up to
the Storm Wall, whence it was thrown
into carts and creels, and driven off to
Kilbarry. The visitors who came to the
place in summer did not work. They came
avowedly to do nothing — to idle through
the sunny weather, to play at fishing,
play at boating, play at swimming, to make
grave business of doing nothing.

I feel it doing me good already,"
said Alfred, as he threw up the window
and spread his chest broad to take a full
inspiration of the invigorating, balsamic
air.

After a late breakfast the two friends
strolled out.

What shall we do to-day ? " said Jerry,
lighting a cio^ar.

What is there to be done ? " asked
Alfred, by way of reply.

Nothing," answered Jerry, throwing
away the match — '* absolutely nothing.
It is because there is nothing to be done
here I thought the place would do you
good."

'' Not by way of change ? " said Alfred,
with a smile.

*' Well, doing nothing at Kilcash is
very different from doing nothing in
London. There you get up, eat breakfast,
look at the morning papers, yawn over a
book; write three notes to say you have
no time to write a letter ; wonder what
the earlier portion of the day was intended
for ; resolve to go to bed early that night
so as to find out the secret ; dress ; go out
nowhere, anywhere ; make a call on a
person whom you don't want to see, and
who doesn't want to see you ; curse yourself
for being so stupid as to look him
up, and him for being so stupid as not
to amuse you ; buy a hairbrush you don't

want ; wonder where people can be going
in hansoms at such an hour, and can't find
out for the life of you where you could go
in a hansom at that time, except to the
British Museum, or Tower, or National
Gallery, or some other place no respectable
person ever yet went to ; drop into a
club for luncheon, and find that no one
you ever saw before lunches at the club,
and that those who do are intensely disagreeable
; stroll into the park ; pick up two
dear old boys, who have been looking for
you everywhere to tell you about something
or other that makes you swear ; back
to the club to dinner, where you meet
every man you care for, and dine ; after
dinner go somewhere or other — to Brown's,
for instance, or to the theatre, or to see the
performing Mastodon ; afterwards cards or
billiards, and bed at half-past two or
three."

That's rather a full and exhausting

VOL. III. F

programme for an idle day. It isn't much
good here. What do you do here a day
you do nothing?"

"Nothing. Whether it's a busy or an
idle day with you here, you can't do
anything, except you get books and go
in for the exact sciences. You couldn't
buy a morning paper here for a sovereign,.
or a pack of cards for a hundred pounds.
The hotel does not take in a paper at
this time of the year, and only three come
to the village — one each to the clergymen,
and oue to the police barracks. The
garrison of the barracks is six men and
a bull-terrier. There's no one to look at
here, and no one to call on, except the
echoes, which at this time of the year
are uncommonly surly, not to say scurrilous.
There is no fish, as the fish have
all gone away on business ; they come
here only to stare at the summer visitors.

The only thing one can do here is smoke
provided you don't buy the tobacco
in the village."

"And walk?" asked Alfred. "Cannot
one walk here ? "

Yes, mostly. Not always, though ;
for when it rains here you have to
swim, and when it blows here, you have
to fly."

But to-day, for instance, we can
walk."

O'Brien looked aloft, looked down in the
light wind, and then out to sea.

Yes, I think it will keep fine."

Well, then, let us walk."

But I forgot to tell you there is no
place to walk to."

Oh, yes, there is. I know more of
the neighbourhood than you, short a time
as I have been here."

^^ Where?"

Kilcash House. Jerry, don't laugh or
don't abuse me. I can't help it. Let me
see where she lived — where she will live
again."

SOLICITOR AND CLIENT.

When Mrs. Davenport reached the
'' Tourists' Hotel," she asked to be shown
into a private sitting-room. She had slept
in the boat, and was in no need of repose.
In reply to the servant, she desired
breakfast to be brought, and asked for
writing materials. She wrote out a telegram
to Blake : "I am staying at the
Tourists,' and shall await you here." She
wrote a couple of notes of no consequence,
and then breakfasted. At the very earliest
Blake could not reach Dublin until that
evening. In the meantime she would go

and see her late husband's solicitor, Mr.
Vincent Lonergan.

The old attorney received Mrs. Davenport
with the most elaborate courtesy. He
was tall, round-shouldered, white-haired,
white-bearded, fresh-coloured, slow, oracular.
He congratulated himself on meeting her
for the first time, and fished up phrases
of sympathy and condolence out of his
inner consciousness, as though he was
the first man in the world who had ever
to refer to such matters. Then he paused,
partly that his elaborate commonplaces
might have time to sink into her mind,
and partly that she might have time to
collect her thoughts and bring her mind
to the business of her visit.

'* May I ask you," she said, "how long
you acted as solicitor to my late husband?"


'* About twelve years, I think. I can
tell you exactly if you desire it."

I will not trouble you for the exact
date. During those twelve years you
were well acquainted with all Mr. Davenport's
affairs, I dare say ? "

*with the legal aspect of his affairs,
yes. With the business aspect of his
affairs, no."

'' You know that he made large *sums
of money by speculating in foreign stocks
and shares ? "

"I do not Jcnoiv it. I have heard it."

"From whom have you heard it?"

From several people — himself among
the number."

She paused a moment, and then said :
'' Your words seem to imply a doubt.
You will, I am certain, give me all the
information you can ? "

"Assuredly, my dear lady."

*' Then do you not know that he made
his money out of foreign speculations ? "

*' Permit me to explain : I did not

intend to imply any doubt as to the
way in which the late Mr. Davenport
made his money. We solicitors get into
a legal way of talking when we are at
business ; and, legally speaking, I have
no knowledge of my own of how the late
Mr. Davenport made his money, because
the making of the money did not come
directly under my observation. I do know
he told me he made it in foreign speculations,
and I think you will be quite safe
in taking it that he did make it abroad.
We are now, as I take it, speaking of
the time before your marriage with Mr.
Davenport ? "

"Yes, of the time before my marriage."

'* Since then, you would naturally know
more of his business affairs than I."

He spoke little to me of business,
and I know hardly anything of his
affairs."

"As you know, you are largely benefited

under the will. Roughly speaking, all his
property goes to you, in addition to what
you are entitled to under the marriage
settlement."

She made a slight gesture, as though
putting these subjects aside.

He made an elaborate gesture, indicating
that he understood her, and that he washer
obedient, humble servant. After
another pause she asked :

"Do you know anything of a man
named Fahey — a man who was in someway
or other connected with Mr.
Davenport, and who was drowned or
committed suicide many years ago, shortly
after Mr. Davenport's marriage ? "

"Fahey — Fahey — Fahey? Yes, I do.
I remember that he drowned himself near
Kilcash House because the police were
on his track for uttering forged bank-notes."

"Do you know in what relation he
stood to Mr. Davenport ? "

I am under the impression lie was
some kind of humble hanger-on ; but I
am not sure."

'* You know nothing of him ? "

Certainly not."

Never saw him ? "

Not to my knowledge."

Another pause.

"You were good enough to tell me a
moment ago that you are acquainted with
the legal business of my late husband.
Suppose I did not wish to take any
money or property under my late
husband's will, how would the matter
be?"

"Not take your husband's money or
property under the will ! You are not,
my dear Mrs. Davenport, thinking of
anything so monstrous ? " cried the old
man, fairly surprised out of his measured
tone and oracular manner.

"Suppose I am. Have I, or shall I

soon have, absolute control over what has
been left to me ? "

Certainly. There are no conditions.
All will be yours absolutely."

Thank you. I am very much obliged.
You will add further to my obligations
to you if you will kindly hurry forward
all matters in connection with the will.
I am most anxious to have the money
in my own hands."

Permit me to explain once more : I
take it for granted you have not had
leisure to read the copy of the will I
forwarded to you ? "

She bowed.

In wills there are often very stupid
conditions and provisions which govern
the disposal of the property. In this case
there are no conditions or provisions, so
that you enter into possession cjuite untrammelled.
You understand me when I
say quite untrammelled ? "

"I understand."

So that if at any time it seemed well

to you to " He stopped. She had

begun to rise, and he did not know
whether it would be wise to complete the
sentence or not.

She stood before him holding out her
hand as she finished what he had beo:un —
*'To marry again I should run no risk
of forfeiting the money."

'' Precisely."

She smiled.

"Thank you. I am a little tired, and
am not able to express my sense of your
goodness to me during this interview.
But I am, I assure you, grateful. I am
not thinking of marriage. You will, I
hope, be able to get everything into
order soon. I must go now. Good-bye."

He saw her into the cab waiting for
her at the door, and then walked back to
his private office.

'* A remarkable woman," he mused, *' a
remarkable and very fine woman. But I
suppose she's mad. There's a screw loose
in the heads of the Davenport family,
and * Evil communications corrupt good
manners.' Perhaps she took the taint
from him. There was no screw loose in
his business head. He was as sharp as
razors, and as close as wax. I think she's
mad, or perhaps she's only a rogue. I
suspect his money was not over clean,
but that's no affair of mine. She married
Davenport, every one said, for his money.
She lived with him all these years for his
money, every one said — although, for the
life of me, I can't see what good it did
him or her ; and now he's gone, and the
money is all hers, and she talks of doing
away with it. Oh, she must be mad, for
I don't see where the roguery could come

in, unless — unless Ah, that may be

it. By Jove, I'm sure that's it ! Byron

says, ' Believe a woman or an epitaph ? ^
But he didn't mean it. Byron hardly
ever meant what he said, and never what
he wrote. It's a pity he never turned his
attention to law. He never, as far as
my reading has gone, did anything with
law except to break all of it he could lay
his hands on — civil and divine — especially
divine, for that's cheap, and he was poor.
She's a very fine woman, though. But
what is this I was saying ? Oh, yes.
The only explanation of her conduct is
that Blake, the blackguard Blake, has
asked her, or is going to ask her, to
marry him, and that she want to test
him by saying she is about to give away
all her money to charitable institutions.
That's the root of the mystery. And
then, when she marries him, she'll throw
all the money into his lap, and he'll
spend it for her, and gamble it away and
beat her. Anyway, he can't make quite

a pauper of lier, for even she herself can't
destroy her marriage settlement, and the
trustees won't stand any nonsense. Always
believe a woman and an epitaph.' I
wonder what kind of an epitaph will she
put up to Davenport ? Something about
his name always reminding her of him —
that she couldn't stand it, and so had to
change it."

THE widow's theory OF THE CASE.

When Mrs. Davenport got back to the
hotel, she inquired if any telegram had
come for her, and was told not. She
seemed displeased, disappointed. She
asked questions, and discovered that it
would be next to impossible that her
telegram could reach London before the
departure of the morning mail. This put
things right, for she felt certain that if
Blake got her message he would have
replied. He was on his way, and would
be in Dublin that evening. In Dublin,
yes ; but how should he know where to

seek her ? She spoke to the manager,
to whom she explained her difficulty.

If the lady telegraphed to the mail-boat
at Holyhead, the gentleman would
be sure to get the message.

She thanked the manager, and adopted
his suggestion. The day was unpleasant
under foot and overhead. There were
no friends upon whom she wished to
call. The ten years of secluded life at
Kilcash House had severed all connection
with old acquaintances, and she had made
no new ones.

She remained by herself in the sitting-room.
She did not even try to read. She
sat in the window, and kept her eyes turned
towards the busy street. It could not
be said she watched the crowds and
vehicles, or was even conscious of their
existence. She kept her eyes in their
direction — that was all.

Luncheon was brought in. She sat

VOL. III. G

at the table for a quarter of an hour,
ate something, and then went back to the
old place at the window. It was dark before
dinner appeared, but she did not ring for
lights. When dinner was over, it was close
to the time for the arrival of the mail. She
put on her bonnet, and went to Westland
Now terminus. The weather was still
unpleasant, but she did not care, did not
heed it. She had not long to wait in
that dismal, squalid cavern at the foot
of the stone steps leading down from the
platform. The train rumbled in, and
the passengers began to descend and pass
between the double row of people.
Suddenly she stepped forward and touched
a man on the arm. He turned quickly,
and looked at her, exclaiming:

"You here, Marion! I got your telegram
on the boat."

'* I was afraid it might miss you, so
T thought it safer to come myself."

"What extraordinary story is this? I
can scarcely believe you were serious
when you wired me yesterday from
Rugby."

''I was in no humour for jesting," she
said. • *' This is no place to talk in. Wait
until we get to the hotel."

When they were seated in Mrs. Davenport's
sitting-room, he waited for her to
speak. She was in the arm of the couch
he by the table, with his elbow resting
on it. They were facing one another.
She clasped her hands in her lap and
rested against the back of the couch.
She was deadly pale, and when she spoke
her voice was low, firm, and full of
thought.

I want you to tell me all you know
about this man Fahey. Mind, you are
to tell me all. There is no use in concealing
anything now. I will not take
a penny of that money. Speak plainly."

G 2

*' Not take the money, Marion ! Are
you mad ? " he exclaimed, starting forward
on his chair.

Not yet. The future of my reason
will depend a good deal on the plainness
of your speech. Go on."

But I have told you all that is worth
telling."

*tell it to me all over again, and
this time add everything, great or little,
you can think of, you can recollect. Let
me judge what is worth listening to, and
what is not. I am waiting."

** I know next to nothing of Fahey,
and never saw the man in all my life.
You are allowing this absurd story of his
ghost to prey on you. You will make
yourself ill."

** Nothing is so bad as uncertainty. I
am racked by uncertainty. Go on if you
wish to do me a service."

Service ! Fd die for your sake, Marion'*

'then speak for mj sake." She did
not move or show any interest one way
or the other in his words, although they
had been spoken pleadingly, passionately.

"At Florence, when he was seized by
that delusion, he raved now and then,
and in his ravings he said continually
that there was a plot to rob and murder
him. He did not include me in the conspiracy,
but all others were leagued against
him. At times he would become furious,
and defy his imaginary foes, swearing
that all of them together were powerless
against him, as Fahey was loyal, and
would be loyal to the death."

'loyal in what?"

I don't know. He did not say in either
his sane or frantic moments."

"What did he say?"

"That Fahey knew, but that no power
on earth would drag the secret out of
Fahey."

"What secret?"

*how should I know?"

Do you know ? "

'' Upon my soul, Marion, I do not."

Well, and after that what would
happen ? "

'' He would laugh and snap his fingers
at imaginary conspirators, and dare them todo
their worst, and then he would break
out into a laugh of triumph. And, as I
hope to live, Marion, that's all."

"Every word?"

*' Every syllable, I swear to you. Marion,
I could not tell you a lie. Marion, I
never loved you until now. If you bid
me, I will die for you. If you tell me,
I will go away and never see you
again. Try me. Bid me go or bid me
die. Tell me to do anything, if you
will only believe I love you as I never
loved you before — as I never loved any
other woman in the world. Since you

will not forgive me, since you will not
give me your love for mine, since you
will not let me be near you or see you,
set me something to do by which I
can show you I am sincere — madly in
earnest."

He bent towards her, and held out his
hands, but did not leave his chair. His
voice, his whole frame shook with excitement.


She raised her hand and lowered it
gently, as a signal that he was to be still
and silent.

He drew his arms and his body quickly
back, and sat mutely regarding her.

"I am sorry," she said, slowly, gently,
that you spoke in that strain now. This
is not the time for such matters "

"Then a time may come, Marion — a
time may come soon or late ? I do nofc
care when "

No," she answered, quietly, resolutely.

That time came and went long ago. Be
silent on that subject. I want to speak
of long ago."

He groaned, and struck his forehead with
his clenched fist.

'^ It was scarcely fair of me to ask you
to come. Will you answer my questions ? ''

Ask me what you please. I'll do it.
The only hope now left to me is that you
will allow me to serve you."

"My next question may be, must be
painful to you."

He laughed bitterly.

"That does not matter. Nothing can
matter now, except feeling I can be of
no use to you."

'what means of influence had you over
my husband beyond what I knew of ? "

*'I am not in the least pained by that
question. I was a poor idiotic fool to
give you up, but I could not support
you if I married you on my own means

then. I had no means. But still less
could I, vile as I was, marry you on
money got from him."

What influence had you ? "

*' I had only one spell to conjure with."

'' And that was ? "

"The name of Fahey."

How did you employ that name ? "

I said to him once, ' Is Fahey still
loyal ? ' I said it half in jest. We were
alone. He beo^ored of me never to mention
that name again, as it recalled his awful
condition in Florence. He said if I would
do him the favour of never referring to
that circumstance or name, he would be
my life-long debtor — adding : * And I mean
what I say, and that it shall have practical
results.' "

"He meant money."

"Yes."

*' Was that before or after he gave you
the thousand pounds ? "

'* Before — some months before. But now-poor
Davenport is no more, and cannot
be hurt by any one. And Fahey is dead,
and can hurt no one, though foolish old
women frighten themselves with the thought
that they have seen his ghost. Did you
know this Fahey ? "

She shuddered. This was the first sign
of feeling she showed. What it sprang
from he could not guess,

I did," she answered, unsteadily.
*rand you believe this story about the
ghost ? "
*^No."

^'Wliat then?"

"That" — with another shudder— " he is
alive."

"Alive, Marion — alive! You are overexcited.
You are talking nonsense. Go
and lie down. You are worn out."

"I am. I feel my head whirling round.
Ijcave me."

He rose obediently to go.

"My mind is giving way, Tom."

That name spoken by her lips again

rooted him to the spot.

They suspected you, Tom, of that awful

deed, and they say he did it himself. I

am going mad. Surely this is madness."
What— what ! Marion ! "
*' And now I suspect — him ! "
Whom, in the name of heaven ? "
Fahey. He was jealous of you both

Why did you put out the lights "

She tottered !

'wherever I CAME I Brought CALAMITY."

Tom Blake was thunderstruck. They were
both standing facing one another a few
feet apart. Blake was not a man to
be disturbed by a trifle. He had been a
good deal about in the world, and had
had experience of various kinds of men and
women. Many years ago he had met this
woman frequently, and in the end he made
love to her. Although she accepted that
love and returned it, she had never taken
him fully into her confidence.

In Marion Butler, as he knew her eleven
or twelve years ago, there had always

been a certain undefined reserve. She
would not refuse to answer any question
put to her, nor was there a doubt she
answered truly and fully. But she always
created the impression that there were
questions which he could not devise or
discover, and the answer to which he was
in no way prepared for. He had no idea
or hint of what these questions might be.
He was in no way uneasy about them. He
was convinced there were portions of her
nature which would always be concealed
from him ; but he was not jealous or suspicious.
He was not then even slightly
disquieted by this blankness, this reticence.
It had no more meaning for him than would
her native tongue, had she been born a
Hindoo and laid that language aside for
English. She had told him she had never
loved any one but him, and he believed her
without the possibility of doubt. She promised
to be his wife, and he believed she

would have stood at the altar with him
though death were his rival for the first
kiss.

But now he was amazed, confounded.
He had never seen the man Fahey, but
he had heard and read in the papers a
little about him, and from all he had
gathered he fancied Fahey was a kind of
upper servant or hanger-on of some kind.
Davenport had spoken to him of Fahey,
but the talk had been very general and
vague, except with regard to the conspiracy,
and the former man always showed the
greatest possible disinclination to hear anything,
or be asked any questions relating
to the latter. Blake had never run the
risk of riding a free horse to death. He
got money in large sums from Mr. Davenport,
but he had been judicious. There
was nothing so low or coarse as blackmail
hinted at by Mr. Davenport. That gentleman
and he were excellent friends, and he

had had bad luck, or was in ayant of money
for some other cause, and when men became
alarmed about money matters, although
they were quite innocent, they often did
foolish things. Look at that idiot Fahey.
So Mr. Davenport, because he was a gentleman
and a friend of Blake's, gave him
money out of mere courtesy and good
nature, and not fear, as one gives to a
strange fellow-pedestrian on the footway
when the stranger carries a load. There
was no more hint of threat or dread of
fear in the case of Mr. Davenport's offering
the money, or of Blake taking it, than in
the case of the meeting of two unacquainted
wayfarers.

He had thought nothing the widow
could tell him would take him by surprise,
and here he now was fairly breathless
and amazed. There was no doubt in his
mind this Fahey had not been the social
equal of Marion Butler, and Blake was of

opinion the man's origin lead been much
lower than Mr. Davenport's, though whence
the dead man had sprung he did not
exactly know. Kilcash House had not
always been the dead man's property. He
had bought it only a little while before
his marriage. Davenport seemed to be a
man accustomed to meet men only. He
was not by any means at his ease in an
ordinary mixed company, and he had explained
this to Blake by saying that until
comparatively late in life he had been
almost wholly a business man and unaccustomed
to the society of ladies.

But now what ghastly light shone on
the dire tragedy of the Crescent House
in Dulwich ! What a wonderful revelation
was this ! Fahey, the humble follower of
the dead man, had been an admirer of
the dead man's wife ; and he who had
been declared dead a decade of years ago
was by her believed to be living, and to

have been connected directly with her
husband's death ! No wonder he was
giddy. No wonder he could find no
words to speak to her. No wonder he
could only stand and gaze at her in
stupid fear, revolving in a dim light the
ghostly pageant of the past.

It was she who broke the silence.

I wish I were dead ! '*

Her voice recalled him to her presence
and the immediate hour. He took her by
the hand, led her to a seat, and began
pacing up and down the room without
speaking.

Advise me," she went on, after a pause.
'* Advise me, out of mercy. If I were
dead, there would be no lips to tell, no
soul to suspect the horrors by which I
am haunted. Advise me. You know
more of me than any other living being.
Shal I die?"

Still he could not speak. Her question

VOL. III. H

came sto Lis ears as though it were something
apart from her personality and his
consideration — as though it were a tedious
impertinence rising from an indifferent
source. Although he knew he was in
that room with the widow of Louis Davenport,
and that she had just said she believed
Fahey was alive, and had killed her husband
from jealousy, he could not give the
situation substantial form. There where
confounding murmurs in his ears, and
indeterminable shadows floating before his
eyes. His mind was clamorous for quiet,
and the clamour stunned and confounded
him.

Speak to me," she pleaded. *' I am
not deserted, yet I am alone. I have
always been alone since I can first remember.
Only I myself have broken the solitude
in which I lived. Once, long ago,
I thought you were coming towards me
from a distance, to share my solitude, but

you — you — went by. I felt like a castaway
on a desolate island, who sees a sail
bear down upon bim in the twilight, only
to find the morning sea a barren desert
of water. Should I die ? That is not a
hard question for you to answer, is it ? "

"No; not a hard question, Marion.
You must live."

For what ? ''

If she had asked this question an hour
ago, before she told him her horrible suspicions,
he would readily have answered,
For me." As it was, such an answer
would have seemed flippant, profane. But
an answer of some kind must be made.
He could find no answer, and said merely,
argive me time."

She sat upright on her chair. One hand
and arm rested on the table, the white
hand lying open upon the leaf, the thumb
holding on by the edge. Her head and
face were thrust forward, her chin projecting,

the forehead reclining. Her eyes, wide
open, followed him closely, intently, but
not eagerly. She seemed curious, more
than anxious. It was as though she took
but a reflected interest in the question,
although the reply might govern her action.
She waited for him patiently. He was a
long time before he spoke.

Marion," he said at length, " if I am
to be of any use to you — if even my
advice is to be of service to you — I must
know all — all, without reserve of any kind.
On the face of it, your question is absurd.
Supposing you had no code — no religious
feeling in the matter ; suppose you had no
fear or hope of the other world, what
earthly good could come of your doing
violence to yourself? — of your throwing
away your life suddenly ? "

While he was saying this, he continued
to walk up and down the room, with hi
eyes bent on the floor.

Her eyes had continued to follow him
in the same close, intent way. Still they
lacked eagerness. She was a pupil anxious
to know — not an enthusiast impatient
to act.

'sit would," she answered, with no
trace of emotion, *' close up his grave forever,
and give peace to his name."

'your husband's — your husband's grave
and name ! Come, Marion, let us be
frank."

"In what am I uncandid?"

"You did not — you swore at the
inquest you didj^not — love your husband,
and now you are talking of killing
yourself for his sake. Marion, you cannot
hold such words candid."

He paused in his walk, and stood
before her. He looked at her a moment,
and then averted his gaze. Her eyes,
although they rested intelligently on him,
did not appear to identify him. They

were the eyes of one occupied with the
solution of a mental problem, aided by
formula of which he was merely the
source.

"Thomas Blake," she said, ^^I once

thought you might grow to understand

me, and then I came to the conclusion

you never could. You are now further

off than ever. Louis Davenport was my

husband, and I belonged to him. I

belong to him still. I swore — as they

were food enough to remind me at the

inquest — to love, honour, and obey him.

I did not come to love him as women

love their husbands, but my feeling

towards him was whole and loyal. I

was his, and I am his; and if my

death, now that he is dead, can benefit

him or comfort his name with quiet, I

am willing to die. Do not be alarmed.

I shall make no unpleasantness here

Do you think I am in the way of his
rest?"

"Marion, you are talking pure nonsense.
Why, your feelings as a Christian
alone "

*' "Who told you I was a Christian ?
I tell you I am a Pagan. Leave me at
least the Pagan virtues of courage and
fearlessness." She did not move.

He looked at her. There could be no
doubt she was sincere. Mad as her words
sounded, they must be taken at the full
value of their ordinary meaning.

"I will not seek to break down your
resolution or turn your purpose aside.
But before I can be of any real use to
you in the way of advice, you must trust
me wholly. How am I to judge of
your duty unless I know the entire case ?
Tell me all you know. Tell me all that
passed between you and this Fahey, and

all you know of the relations between
him and your husband."

**I will tell you all you need know."

"Do you think you are a good judge
of where your confidence in a matter of
this importance should end ? "

"I think I am. At all events, I shall
be reticent if I consider it better not
to speak."

*well, then, go on, Marion, and tell
me all you may. Mind, the more I
know the more likely I am able to be
of use to you."

She passed the hand not resting on
the table across her forehead.

Sit down," she said. '^ I can speak
with greater ease while you are sitting."

He took a chair directly opposite her,
and she began :

"All that I said at the inquest is
true, and I told the whole truth in
answer to any questions I was asked ;

but I did not say all that was in my
mind. I have had bitter trials in my
life. I will not refer again to what was
once between you and me ; and, remember,
in anything I may say I shall
have no thought of that. I put that
away from my mind altogether, and it
will be ungenerous of you if you draw
any deduction towards our relations in
the past from anything I may say. Is
that understood ? "

"Perfectly, Marion. I know you too
well to fancy for a moment you could
be guilty of the mean cowardice of talking
at any one. Go on."

Thank you. I am glad you think I
am no coward." She still kept her hand
before her face, as though to concentrate
her attention upon her mental vision.
*' As I said at that awful inquest, there
was never anything ever so slightly like
a quarrel between Mr. Davenport and me.

Except that we lived almost exclusively
at Kilcash House, which was dull, I had
little or nothing to complain of; and the
great quiet and isolation of that place did
not affect me much, for I had small or
no desire to go out into the world, and
after a few years it would have given
me more pain than pleasure to have to
mingle in society. Very shortly after my
marriage I met Michael Fahey for the
first time "

"What was he like?" asked Blake,
interrupting her.

He was tall and slender. His hair
was brown, his eyes light in colour — blue,
I think. He wore a moustache of lighter
colour than his hair, and small whiskers
of the same colour. He was good-looking
in a way "

'' What kind of way ? "

'' Well, a soft and gentle way. At first
he struck me as being a man who was

weak, mentally and physically. Later
I had reason to think him a man of
average, if not more than average, physical
strength."

'about how old was he then?"
I could not say exactly. Under thirty,
I should think. He also struck me as a
man of not cjuite good social position.
His manners were uneasy, apprehensive,
and his English uncertain. He was restless
and ill at ease, and for my own peace
of mind I was glad when I parted from
him ; for it struck me he would be much
more comfortable if he and my husband
were left alone together.

My husband spoke to me in the highest
terms of Fahey, and said that although
he wished nothing to be said about it
just then, or until he gave me leave to
mention it, Fahey had done him useful
service in his time. That was all Mr.
Davenport volunteered, and I asked no

question. I was sure of one thing more
namely, that the less I was with Michael
Fahey the better my husband would be
satisfied.

*' I smiled when this conviction came
first upon me. Up to the moment I
felt it I had in my mind treated this
Fahey as a kind of upper servant, who
was to be soothed into unconsciousness
that he was not an equal. For a short
time I felt inclined to expostulate with
Mr. Davenport on the absurdity of fancying
Fahey could think of me save as
the wife of his patron ; but I kept silence,
partly out of pride and partly out of
ignorance of the relations which really
existed between this man and my husband.
You may, or may not, have heard
of a circumstance which occurred shortly
after my marriage ? "

'^I remember nothing noteworthy. Tell
me what it was."

'eat that time it was Mr. Davenport's
habit to keep large sums of money in
the house. Once upon his having to go
away for a few days, he left me the
keys of the safe in which the money
was locked up. While he was away, an
attempt was made to rob the house. A
door was forced from outside, and two
men were absolutely in my room, where
I kept the key of the safe, when Fahey,
who was staying in the village of Kil-cash
at the time, rushed in and faced
the thieves. I was aroused and saw the
struggle. Fortunately the men were unarmed.
The light was dim — only my
low night lamp.

'the first blow Fahey struck he
knocked one of the men through a window.
Then he and the other man
struggled a long time, and at last the
thief broke loose and escaped by the
way he had come in. Fahey had overheard

the two thieves plan the robbery
in the village, and had followed them
that night to our house. My husband
wished the matter to be kept quiet, and
so it was hushed up.

'the next time I met Fahey after
that night I was alone on the downs.
He was alone too. I stopped to thank
him. I do not remember exactly what
I said — commonplace words of gratitude,
no doubt. While I was speaking I was
close to him, and gazing into his face.
I cut my speech short, for I saw a lookin
his eyes that told me I was not
indifferent to him."

The widow's hand fell from her face,
and she looked at her visitor with an expression
of trouble and dismay.

There was nothing distressing or alarming
in that," said Blake, with an encouraging
smile. "You must remember you were

then, as you are now, an exquisitely
lovely woman.

'"a^o marvel, sovereign lady; in fair field
Myself for such a face had boldly died'"

Ay, ay," she said, with a shudder and
a glance of horror round the room. " In
the stanza before the one from which you
quote my fate is written :

' Where'er I came I brought calamity.' "

She stared before her, shuddered again,
and sighed.

"Well'' said he. 'you have more
to tell me?"

"Yes; I'll go on."

A COMPACT.

Mrs. Davenport rested slightly against
the back of her chair, and resumed :

' Mrs. Davenport said Fahey, ' what
I have done for you was nothing. It was
really not done for you at all. It was
done for Mr. Davenport, not you. The
thieves did not want to steal you. They
wanted to steal Mr. Davenport's money.
If I may presume to ask you for that
rose, I shall consider myself more than
repaid for what I have done.'

"I gave him the rose. He bowed, and
said : ' Yes, they were stupid, mercenary

fools. They thought a few pounds of
more value than anything else in the
world. I am not a rich man, and I care
very little for money itself. I care more
for what it may bring with it. I would
not care to be the richest man in the
world. I have in my time, Mrs. Davenport,
been the humble means of forwarding
Mr. Davenport's plans for making
money. He is a rich man. He is rich in
more ways than money.' Here he raised
the rose to his lips and kissed it. I stood
amazed. I could not speak or move."

'^ Are you sure the man was serious,
and that he meant it fully ? — or was it
only a piece of elaborate gallantry ? " asked
Blake, in perplexity.

"There can be no doubt whatever of
his absolute sincerity. Listen. I merely
smiled, as if I did not catch his drift,
and moved as though I would resume
my walk towards home. He lifted his

VOL. III. I

hat, and, standing uncovered, with his
hat in one hand and the rose I had
given him in the other, said :

*' ' I would not give this rose for all
Mr. Davenport's money, and I know more
about his money than any other man
living. Mr. Davenport and I have been
close friends for a long time. It is my
nature to be loyal. I have been loyal to
him. If I liked I could do him injury
irreparable injury. If I cared, I could
ruin him utterly. But it is my nature to
be loyal. Do you credit me ? '

'for a few seconds I did not answer.
I believed he was crazy, and I thought
that I must soothe him in some way and
get off. I had become apprehensive, so
I said : ' I am perfectly sure of your loyalty
to Mr. Davenport. I have always heard my
husband speak of you in the highest terms,
I hope we may soon have the pleasure
of seeing you again at the House.'

"not yet,' he said — 'do not leave me
yet. I want to say a few more words
to you. It is easy to listen. Listen, pray.
I would not, as I said before, give that
rose for all his money. If I chose to
speak, things might be different with him.
By fair means or by foul, I will not say
which, I could make his wealth melt
like snow in the sun. But I have no
caring, no need for wealth. I shall not
hurt him if you will make me t^vo promises.
Will you make the two promises
I ask

By this time I felt fully persuaded I
was in the presence of a madman. I looked
around and could see no one but the man
before me. We were not a hundred yards
from the edge of the cliff. I no longer
thought him physically weak ; his encounter
with the thieves had settled that point.
If he were mad, the promise would count
for nothing. There could be no doubt he

I 2

was insane. I resolved to try him : * Howls
it possible for me to make two promises
to you until I know what they are ? '

* Your husband trusts me — you may
trust me. Do you promise?'

' First let me know what the promises
are.'

*^ * That you will say nothing of what I
have said to you to Mr. Davenport, and
that, if ever I have it in my power to do
you another service, and do it, you will
give me another rose.'

'* ^ Yes ; in both cases,' I answered. ' You
may rest satisfied.'

I got away then and was very glad to
escape. There was no occasion to speak to
any one about this meeting with Fahey on
the downs, unless indeed I firmly believed
he was mad ; and now that I had time to
recall all he had said, and review all his
actions, I began seriously to question my
assumption as to his insanity. I took the

first opportunity of asking my husband if
there was anything remarkable about Fahey.
Mr. Davenport seemed a good deal put outby
the question, and asked me what I
meant. I said I thought Fahey was odd
at times. My husband said Fahey was all
right, and did not seem disposed to go on
any further with the conversation.

I did not meet Fahey again for a
long time — I mean months. He then
seemed quite collected ; but before wishing
good-bye, he said significantly : ' A man
may disappear at any moment on a coast
like this, and yet may not be dead. Now,
suppose I were to disappear suddenly on
this coast, you would think I had died,
and that Mr. Davenport no longer ran
any risk from my being talkative, or you
any chance of being called upon for that
other rose. I am not enamoured of this
coast. I consider it dreary and inhospitable,
and it would not at all

surprise me if one day 1 packed up and
led far away, and stopped away until
almost all memory of me was lost. Do
you think, Mrs. Davenport, that if, after
such an absence, I were to come back,
you would recognise me ? '

I answered that I was sure of it, and
got away from him as soon as I could.
Again I spoke to Mr. Davenport about
Fahey's sanity. My husband did not
seem to care about discussing the subject,
and so I let the matter drop. Afterwards,
when Fahey jumped into the Puffing Hole
in order to avoid the police, I thought to
myself that when he talked about disappearing
from the coast he was much nearer
the truth than he had any notion of.

"All this occurred many years ago, but
it made a great impression on my mind,
and I have not forgotten a tittle of it.
The words Fahey spoke, and the way he
looked, are as plain to me now as if it all

happened only yesterday. For a longtime
after Fahey had disappeared, I
believed his death at the Black Rock
was nothing more than a pure coincidence.
Now and then, at long intervals, Mr.
Davenport would refer to the matter, but
always in tones of anxiety and doubt.
I do not know why I got the notion into
my head, but gradually it found its way
there, until at last I became quite sure
Fahey was not dead. On more than one
occasion when I had ventured to suggest
such an idea to Mr. Davenport's mind,
he showed great emotion, and, after a few
struggles, either directly dismissed or
changed the subject.

*'If Fahey had been right about his
power of disappearing from that coast
without dying, why should I refuse to
believe that Fahey could injure — nay, ruin,
my husband, if he were to appear and
make certain statements of matters within

this own knowledge ? What these matters
were I could not guess. Since I saw you
last I have got good reasons to feel sure
my husband had no proper right to the
money he possessed, and that this man
Fahey was aware of the facts of the case."

"How did you find all this out,
Marion?" asked Blake, looking across at
her with freshly awakened interest.

I found papers of my husband's."

"Will you tell me how you believe he
came by the money?"

"No. And you must say nothing of
this conversation to any living being."

"Trust me, I will not."

The difficulties now are, Thomas Blake,
that I believe my husband did not come
fairly by his fortune, that Michael Fahey
is still alive, and that he had a hand in
the death of my husband."

Blake knit his brows, rose, and recommenced
walking up and down the room.

"Mr. Jerry O'Brien, who travelled over
from London with me, told me after we
left Euston that he himself and Phelan,
the boatman of Kilcash, had seen the ghost
or body of Fahey on the cliffs just above
the Black Eock/'

"It may have been a delusion."
*eyes, it may; but the chances are ten
thousand to one against it. He told me,
too, that a friend of his had seen the
same figure, clad in the same clothes it
wore ten or a dozen years ago. The
last-named phenomenon I cannot account
for. But if you can believe that a
man who jumped into the Puffing Hole
years ago is still alive, all other beliefs
in this case are easy. Now, Thomas
Blake, I have spoken more fully to you
than I have ever spoken to any other
man. I want you to advise and help

me.

*how?" asked Blake, stopping in his

walk and looking straight into her white,
fixed, expressionless face.

"By finding out Fahey and discovering
whence my husband got his money. Then,
if I may return it without disgracing his
name or exposing him, I will, and if
not "

'well, Marion, if not?"

I shall put an end to my knowledge
and myself, and so keep his grave quiet
and silent for him."

*' Marion, this is sheer madness."

"So much the better. If I do wrong
in an access of insanity, no moral blame
attaches to me or my act. Will you
help me ? Once upon a time I could
have counted on your aid."

At that time you held out the promise
of a glorious reward. Do you hold it
out still, Marion?"

"No. That thought must be put to
rest for ever. You may think it monstrous

that such being my mind, I should deliberately
seek you and ask for your
help. But I have no future, and you
are all that is left to me of the past "

"Marion, Marion, for Heaven's sake
don't say it is too late ! " he cried,
passionately, and advanced a step towards
her.

She retired two steps, and made an
imperative gesture, bidding him stand still.

"Stay where you are and listen to me.
To quote again from the poem you quoted
awhile ago, 'My youth,' she said, *was
blighted with a curse.' "

"And," he said, pointing to himself,
"if we alter the text slightly, we find
'This traitor was the cause.' Is not that
what you mean, Marion ? Do not spare
me ; I am meet for vengeance."

The present one is not a case for vengeance.
But if you like you may in this
matter expiate the past."

"And when my expiation is complete,
in what relation shall you and I stand
to one another?"

'sin the same relation as before we
met. You will be just to me, and help mein
this matter, Thomas Blake. Remember
that my life has not been very joyous."

'' But, Marion," he urged, softening his
voice, and leaning towards her, *4f I am
to take what you say at its full value "

"I mean it all quite literally."

"Then my expiation would assume the
form of leading you to the tomb instead of
the altar."

She drew back, and said :

Yes, put it that way if you will. Atone
time I believed your hand was guiding
me up to the altar, beyond which lay love
and life, and all manner of good and bright
things. We never reached the altar. But
something happened, and there was a dull,
dead pause in life, like the winter sleep of a

lizard or the trance of the Sleeping Beauty,
and then I awoke, and, to my horror, found
the altar had been changed into a tomb, and
the Fairy Prince into Death. There was
no time for love. I had slept through the
period of love. I had no power to hate,
but I had the power and the will to die.
You will help me ? "

Not to die, Marion. I will help you to
solve the mystery of this Fahey, and the
relations between him and Mr. Davenport,
and then when all has been cleared uj), you
may "

He held out his hand pleadingly.

"Yes," she said, coldly, firmly, 'when all
has been cleared up, I may say — good-bye."

AN EXPEDITION Proposed.

When Jerry O'Brien said there was absolutely
nothing to be done in Kilcash, he
had told the naked truth. The weather
was still far from genial, and Jerry and
Alfred Paulton were the only visitors in
that Waterford village. For a man of
active habits, in full bodily and mental
vigour, the place would have been the
very worst in the world ; but for an
invalid who had never been a busy manit
was everything the most exacting could
desire. If Alfred's mind had only been
as peaceful as his surroundings, he would

have picked up strength visibly from hour
to hour.

But his mind was not at ease. For good
or evil, he did not care which, he had
given his heart to that woman, and now
once more the shadow of this objectionable,
this disreputable man Blake, had come
between her and him. The most disquieting
circumstance in the case was that
Blake had not intruded, but had been
summoned by her. It is true that on
closer examination this did not seem to
point to a love affair between the two ;
for unless a woman was fully engaged to
a man, she would scarcely, he being her
lover, summon him to her side, under the
circumstances in Mrs. Davenport's case.

Such thoughts and doubts were not the
best salve for a hurt constitution ; and
although Alfred recovered strength and
colour from day to day, he did not derive
as much benefit from Kilcash as if his

mind had been even as untroubled as it had
been when the journey from Dulwich began.

Jerry was by no means delighted with
affairs. He put the best face he could
on things, but still he was not content.
As far as he was concerned, the detested
Fishery Commissioners had gone to sleep,
but there was no forecasting the duration
of their slumber. Any moment they might
shake themselves, growl, wake, and swallow
up all his substance.

Until they are done with this part of
the unhappy country, I shall feel as if the
country was overrun by 'empty tigers,' and
I was the only wholesome piece of flesh
after which the man-eaters hankered."

O'Brien did not pretend to be a philosopher
when his own fortune or comfort was
threatened or assailed. He chafed and
fumed when things went wrong, or when
he could not get his way. Now he was
compelled, in a great measure, to keep

silent, for there would be a want of hospitality
in displaying impatience of Kilcash
to Alfred. He had confided to the latter
the secret of his love for Madge, and the
brother had grasped his hand cordially and
wished him all luck and happiness. No
man existed, he had said, to whom he
would sooner confide the future of his sister.
How was O'Brien to act with regard to
writing to Madge ? There had been nothing
underhand or dishonourable in telling the
girl of his love that day on the Dulwich
Eoad. The declaration had in a measure
slipped from him before any suitable opportunity
occurred of talking to Mr. Paulton.
But speaking to Madge under the excitement
of the moment and the knowledge
of approaching separation was one thing,
and writing clandestinely to her quite
another. If he wrote to her openly, inquiries
as to the nature of the correspondence
would certainly be made at home,

VOL. III. K

and then their secret would be found out,
and the thought of being found out in
anything about which an unpleasant word
could be said was unendurable. In the
haste of leaving Carlingford House he had
made no arrangement with Madge as to
writing to her. It was absolutely necessary
for him to risk a letter. He would
not be guilty of the subterfuge of writing
under cover of one of Alfred's letters.
Accordingly he wrote a bright, cheerful,
chatty note to Madge, beginning " My
dear Miss Paulton," and ending "Yours
most sincerely, J. O'Brien." To those who
were not in the secret, nothing could have
been more ordinary than this letter. But
its meaning was plain to Madge. Among
other things, he said the Commissioners
had not yet done with him, and until they
had he could not count upon another visit
to Dulwich ; and he begged her to give his
kindest regards to Mr. Paulton, and to

express a hope that he might soon enjoy
the pleasure of a walk on the Dulwich
Eoad, when he would tell her father all
about the Bawn salmon and the wretched
Commissioners. Until then he should not
bother either of them with any account of
himself or the villains who were lying in
wait for him. This he intended to show
that he would not write to her again until
he had cleared up matters with her father.
And now that he had got rid of this
letter — it was a task, not a pleasure, to
write it — what should he do ? He had
told himself and Alfred that even in
summer there was not anything to be
done in Kilcash. But he, O'Brien, was
in full health and vigour, and began to
feel uneventful idleness very irksome.
Boating even with the pretence of fishing
was out of the question, and one grew
tired of strolling along the strand or
downs when fine, and looking out of the

E 2

windows at the unneeded rain when wet.
Against the weariness of the long evenings
he had brought books, cards, and
chess from Kilbarry. Time began to hang
heavily on his hands. Nothing more had
been heard or seen of the ghost of Fahey,
and the two friends had been a couple
of times to see the outside of Kilcash
House, whither, he believed, Mrs. Davenport
had not yet arrived from Dublin.

The weather was mild, moist, calm.

"I'll tell you what we shall do,
Alfred," said Jerry briskly at breakfast
one morning.

'^ What ? " asked the other, looking up
from his plate.

"There isn't a ripple on the sea. I'll
go see Jim Phelan, and get him to launch
his boat."

Capital ! " cried Alfred, who was in
that state of convalescence when the
daily addition to physical strength begets

a desire to use it and yields indestructible
buoyancy. " I should like a good long-sail
of all things — or, indeed, a good pull.
I'm sure I could manage an oar nearly
as well as ever."

Nonsense ! " said Jerry, dogmatically.
I will not be accessory to your murder,
or allow you to commit suicide in my
presence. I have had enough of inquests
for my natural life. It's too cold for
sailing, and you're not strong enough for
rowing. But there are the caves. The
time of the year doss, not make any
difference in them, so long as the sea is
smooth. They are as warm in winter as
in summer. We can bring torches and
guns, and a horn and grub with us. A
torchlight picnic would be a novelty tome,
anyway. The echoes in some places
are wonderful, and I'll answer for the
food being wholesome. I'll go down to
Phelan immediately after breakfast."

Big Jim Phelan was at home in his
cottage — not the shelter that covered him
in the summer, but the one which the
high and mighty of the land could rent
for eight to twelve pounds a month when
they wished to enjoy the sea.

O'Brien explained his design.

"Are you mad, sir?" said Jim,
drawing back from the chair which he
had placed for his unexpected guest.

"No. Why? What's mad about it?
I and my friend want to see the caves,
and they are just as good at this time of
year as in summer. Will you take us ? —
Yes or no ? Or are you afraid ? "

"Fm not afraid of anything that
swims or walks or flies, Mr. O'Brien,"
said Jim in a tone of indignant protest.
But nature is nature, and it's not right
to fly in the face of nature."

"Face of fiddlestick!" said O'Brien.
What has nature to do with our going

to visit the caves ? If you don't take us,
some one else will. AVhat on earth do you
mean by 'flying in the face of nature?"

'' Go to the caves at this time of
year ! " said Jim, in a musing tone of
voice. "Why, no one ever thought of
such a thing before ! "

'what difference does that make?
No strangers are here, except in summer ;
and of course the people of the village
never want to go to the caves either
winter or summer, unless they are paid.
Come on, Jim ; don't send me off to look
for some one else. I like to stick to old
friends."

Phelan reflected awhile. There was no
greater danger on such a day as this in
going to the caves than on the finest
day in July. But the novelty of the
idea was almost too much for Jim. That
any man in his sober senses could even
during the dog-days want to go to the

caves was wonderful enough ; but that
a man, and, moreover, a man who had
lived most of his life hard by, could think
of exploring those gloomy vaults in the
chilly, damp days of spring, was too much
for belief. O'Brien was liberal, and if he
happened to spend a couple of the summer
months at Kilcash, as he had hinted, Jim
was certain to be a few pounds the better for
it. But it wouldn't do to give in too easily.

Mr. O'Brien, if you're bent on going,
of course I must take you. I'll go to
the Cove of Cork for you, sir, single-handed,
in my own yawl. But mind
you, sir, it wasn't I that put you up to
going. If you ask me my advice, I say
don't go. I won't take any of the responsibility,
mind, sir."

All right," cried O'Brien, with a laugh.
"You know as well as I do that there
is no danger on a calm day like this.
How soon will you be ready ? "

I'll have to get a man to go with me,
and gather a few hands to help to launch
the yawl. Will an hour be soon enough,
sir?" said Jim, who, now that he had
decided on action, was already busy in
preparation.

Yes ; an hour will do. How is the
tide?"

"About an hour flood."

And how will that answer for the
Eed Cave?"

Eed Cave ! " said Phelan, pausing suddenly
in his preparation. "Is it Eed Gap
Cave you're thinking of going to, sir ? "

There was a sound of uneasiness in the
boatman's voice.

Yes. Isn't it the largest ? Isn't it the
one they say has never been explored ? "

Ay, sir. It never has been explored
fully, and I don't suppose ever will —
for what would be the good ? — and it
isn't over agreeable in there, with its

windings and twisting, I can tell you.
I don't mind much about the Eed Cave
itself; but, Mr. O'Brien, it's only a little
bit beyond the Whale's Mouth, and you
have some queer notions about that cursed
place ; and, mind, I'll have nothing todo
with it for love or money."

'* I didn't say anything about the
Whale's Mouth," said O'Brien, in a tone
of irritation. *' I asked you how is the
tide for the Eed Cave ? Can't you answer
a simple question ? "

'•'The tide is always right for the Eed
Cave," answered Phelan, sullenly. " You
can always go into it when the water is
smooth''

*every well. I'll expect you on the
strand by the rocks in an hour;" and
saying this, O'Brien left the cottage and
set out for the hotel.

AT THE whale's MOUTH.

Eed Head is about a pistol-shot from
the Black Rock to the east. It is a tall,
perpendicular red cliff, more than a hundred
feet high, projecting from the land
a few hundred yards, and rising up sheer
out of deep water. In places it overhangs
slightly — in places reclines. The
rocks of which it is formed are in no
place angular, show no sharp fracture,
declare no brittleness in formation. They
are rounded and smooth like the human
hand, abrupt nowhere, save in their giddy
descent to the water.

The middle of the Head is cleft in
two a hundred yards inward. This cleft
is called the Gap, or the Eed Grasp, and
is as wide as the nave of St. Paul's. At
the depth of a hundred yards in the Gap
the height of the opening suddenly
grows less, and the mouth of a huge
cave is formed by the precipitous sides,
and an irregular, blunted, Gothic roof of
the same firm, smooth red rock. The
vast chamber, or system of chambers,
beyond, is the Eed Gap Cave, for brevity
called the Eed Cave.

At the time appointed, O'Brien and
Paulton found Jim Phelan and his mate
Tim Corcoran afloat on the bay by the
flat stretch of rocks which served Kilcash
as a landing-stage. Billy Coyne had
brought down a basket of food, some
torches, a crimson light, and gun — the
torches and light to illumine the gloom.

and the gun to awaken the echoes of the
vast vault.

The day was fair and bright, with chill
spring sunshine. Overhead vast fields of
silvery white clouds stretched motionless
across the full azure sky. There was no
breath of wind, no threat of rain, no
look of anger anywhere. The waters of
the bay moved inward with a silken
ripple that scarcely stirred the yawl as
she glided slowly onward. When she
reached the open water beyond the bay,
and headed first south and then east, she
met the long, even Atlantic roller, which
glided towards her and under her as silently
and gently as a summer's breeze. No sound
broke the plenteous silence but the ripple of
the water against the sides, the snap of the
oars in the rowlocks, and the dull beat
of the waves against the foam-footed
crags. No ship, no boat, no bird was in

view. The solitude of the air and sea
was complete. The sounds of the sea on
the crags seemed not the distant notes of
opening war, but the soft prelude to
long, breathless peace.

They rowed in silence until they were
close to the Black Kock, until it rose
dark, inhospitable, forbidding above them.
Phelan was on the stroke, Corcoran on
the bow oar. The yawl was now abreast
the point at which the Black Rock joined
the cliff at the westward. There was no
rudder to the boat. On that coast
rudders are looked on as foppery. In
smooth weather the stroke steers from
the rowlocks ; in a sea-way some one
steers with an additional oar from the
sculling notch. O'Brien and Paulton were
aft, but there was no oar in the sculling
notch to steer with.

They were keeping a clean wake, and
owing to the swelling out of the Black

Rock they would, if they held on as they
were going, pass within a few score fathoms
of the Whale's Mouth. It was now about
half flood.

All at once Jim Phelan began to ease
without looking over his shoulder.

Pull, after oar — ease bow ! " sang
out O'Brien, quickly.

The bow eased as ordered, but, contrary
to the order, the stroke oar stopped pulling
altogether, and Phelan looked up with an
angry expression at O'Brien.

** I said ease bow — pull stroke' said
O'Brien, quickly, in a tone of irritation.

*rand I say — stop all," said Phelan,
decisively.

Corcoran rested on his oar, and for a
few seconds O'Brien and. Phelan sat looking
at one another. It was plain O'Brien
was angry, and that Phelan was resolute.
Paulton had no key to the difficulty.
The clumsy yawl rose to the top and slid

into the trough of two long, slow rollers
before either of the men spoke further.

Jim Phelan peaked his oar and broke
silence.

"Mr. O'Brien, I told you I wouldn't,
and I won't. That's all."

'you won't what, you stubborn fool?"

O'Brien was hot, but he had not lost
his temper.

"I told you," said Phelan, leaning his
great body forward, and resting his hands
on his thighs, *ras plain as words could
be that I'd have nothing to do with the
Whale's Mouth. You may not care about
your life, Mr. O'Brien, but I have people
looking to me. You're independent, and
can do what you like ; but neither for
you nor any other man will I go nearer
than I think safe to the Whale's Mouth.
The Ked Gap is bad enough at this time
of year ; but not at this time of year or
any other will I have anything to do

with that cursed hole in the Black Rock
here. Now, sir, am I to put about?"

I think you're taking leave of your
senses, Phelan," said Jerry, testily. " What
on earth put it into your head I wanted
to go into the Whale's Mouth? Why,
if I wanted to do anything half so plucky
as that, I'd get a man with a rec liver,
and a heart as big as a sparrow's ! Give
way, I tell you."

An ugly look came into Ph elan's face.
He was not bad-tempered or quarrelsome,
but he justly had the reputation of being
the most daring and the strongest man
in the village. He was not very intelligent,
and this was the first time in
his life he had been accused of cowardice.
He felt more amazed than angry, but
he felt some anger. He knew he could,
if he chose, catch O'Brien by the feet
and throw him over the gunwale as easily
as the oar lying across his legs. For a

VOL. HI. L

moment he thought the cold swim would
do O'Brien good, but almost instantly he
saw the punishment would be out of
proportion to the offence. He drew a
deep breath, partly straightened himself,
and, catching his oar, said :

'' Are we to go on to the Red Gap,
sir ? "

'^ Yes, confound you ! '' said O'Brien, far
from amiably. '' Keep as close to the
rock as you think is safe, quite safe, Phalanx
wouldn't risk yom life for a thousand
pounds."

Thank you, sir'' said Phelan, sullenly.
'' Neither would I — in a cave ; but if
it came to anything between man and
man "

"I know," broke in O'Brien, with a
laugh, ** you'd be glad to risk your neck
to satisfy your anger."

He had suddenly regained his good
humour.

*' That's it," said Phelan, laconically, as
the yawl moved on.

Paulton looked in surprise from one
to the other. O'Brien smiled and shook
his head to reassure him, but said nothing.
Visibly the spirits of the little party were
damped.

At length they were opposite the much-dreaded
Whale's Mouth. The two rowers,
at the request of O'Brien, peaked their
oars a few fathoms out of the direct set
of the in-draught, now at its greatest
strength.

The wall of rock, in which the opening
of the cave appeared, was at this time
of tide almost square, and considerably
wider than the yawl was long. Nothing
could be more harmless-looking than the
Mouth. Its sides were smooth and almost
perpendicular. No huge mass of rock
hung threateningly on high ; the water
beneath was pellucid, green, gentle. No

L 2

awful sounds issued from that Mouth. The
internal sounds told of little disturbance or
danger. No sign of conflict appeared
on the sides of the Mouth or the water,
or in the soft olive depths below. In
the heat of summer a stranger would
have found it almost impossible to deny
himself the luxurious refreshment of repose
in the moist twilight of that water-cave.

No teeth were visible ; but the lithe,
subtle, unceasing, undulating tongue was
there — the polished, subtle water. It rose
and fell, seemingly, as the water round
it, in indolent, purposeless indifference ;
and looking at the water merely, it
seemed to make no greater progress
onward than the water outside and
around. Yet the gentle swelling and
hollowing of the waves had a purpose
underlying, though they seemed, like other
waves, to move tardily, almost imperceptibly
forward. But here the water

was dragged onward occultly by some
power, and for some purpose unknown.
The roof of the Mouth and the jaws
were powerless for evil. No teeth were
visible in this gigantic Mouth, but the
unsuspected, oily, slimy water was there
lying in wait for the unwary, and fatal
to all things that touched it.

It was the tongue of the ant-bear that
attracts, enfolds, and finally engulphs its
prey in its noisome maw.

"Is that the Whale's Mouth of which
you told me, Jerry?" asked Alfred.

*' That's it," answered Jerry, shortly.
He took up one of the torches lying on
the stern-sheets and threw the torch
towards the cave into the sea.

"It doesn't appear very dreadful now —
does it?"

'* Watch that torch. No sea looks very
terrifying in a calm," said Jerry, sharply.

He had not yet quite recovered from the

passage of arms with Phelan. The boatman
had annoyed him by extravagantly
over-estimating the dangers and powers of
the chasm, and Paulton now ruffled him by
seeming to make nothing of them.

Slowly but surely the torch was carried
towards the Whale's Mouth. Slowly at
first, but more quickly as it approached
the rock, more quickly as it approached
the cave. Second by second the rate increased,
until, when it reached the Mouth
and disappeared, it was hurrying on as fast
as a man could walk.

** That's strange ! " said Alfred. " I think
you told me no one has been able to find
out where all this water goes to."

*' To a place that's more hot than comfortable,"
said Phelan grimly, directing a
look of inquiry towards Jerry.

*sit all comes back again," said Jerry.

Barring what doesn't," muttered Phelan.

Pull a stroke or two, Tim," he said to the
other boatman. '^ The current is under her
keel already, and bad as this world is, I
haven't made my will yet. A couple of
more strokes, Tim."

He looked at Alfred and addressed him,
although he could not do so by his name,
as he had never heard it.

'^ I beg your pardon, sir ; but if you'd
like to make money, sir, I'll lay you the
price of this day's work to a brass button
you never see that torch again, and I'll
lie by to watch for it until the ebb is
done."

Alfred did not answer. His eyes had
been raised for a few moments, and were
now firmly fixed on the plain of the Black
Kock. Jerry was peering intently into the
jaws of the Whale's Mouth. Phelan was
looking into Alfred's face to see the effect
of his offer.

Jerry ! " cried Alfred, abruptly.

What ? " asked Jerry, without moving
his eyes from the cavern.

There's some one on the Black
Rock."

'' Good heavens ! " exclaimed O'Brien,
looking up. "Not Fahey?"

"No," said Alfred. "It's Mrs. Davenport!"


THE Need CAVE.

There was no mistaking that figure, and if
the figure had not been ample confirmation
of identity, there were the full widow's
weeds, and, above all, the pale, placid
face. The full light of the unclouded sun
fell on her. The distance was not great,
and she stood out in bold relief against the
white field of cloud stretching across the
northern sky.

On impulse, Alfred rose in the boat,
and took ofi" his hat and bowed.

She returned his salute, and without a
moment's pause drew back from the edge on

which she had been standing, and disappeared
from view.

'' Mrs. Davenport ! " said Phelan, forgetting
his ill-humour in his surprise. 'what
a place for a lady to be all by herself ! I
thought Mrs. Davenport was away somewhere
in foreign parts."

Alfred sat down. The boatmen had
resumed their oars, and the yawl was
gliding steadily through the water.

"Is the Rock really dangerous at this
time?" asked Alfred anxiously of PhelaUo
O'Brien was buried in thought, and did
not heed what the others were saying.

Not dangerous now, sir — not dangerous
when the water is so smooth and the air
so calm ; but if there's a little sea on, and
a little breeze, you never know what may
happen here. Sometimes the sea alone
will do it, and sometimes the wind alone
will do it, and sometimes both together
won't do it. You can only be sure she'll

spout when the sea is high and the wind
a strong gale from the south-west. What
surprises me to see the lady there is because
the place has a bad name, and she was just
standing on the worst spot of all when
we saw her first."

"How a bad name, and how the worst
place of all ? Are you quite sure there
is no danger to the lady now?" asked
Alfred, struggling violently and successfully
to conceal his extraordinary solicitude.

*' I am perfectly sure there is no danger
of the spout now. The reason I said it
has a bad name is because of all the people
who were carried off that Rock ; and where
Mrs. Davenport stood is just the worst
spot of all."

But Mrs. Davenport must know the
Rock well. I dare say, as her house is near,
she often comes to see it."

"Ay, she may often come to see it.
But to see it and to walk on it are different

things. There are very few women in the
village who would care to go on it without
a man to lend them a hand. Why, sir,
it's as slippery as ice, and two people fell
and were killed on it out of regard to its
slipperiness."

Is there no way of landing here ? "

''No, sir. You can't get a foot ashore
anywhere nearer than Kilcash. You might,
of course, land on many a rock here and
there, but you couldn't get up the cliffs.
It's iron-bound for miles."

"But could not the lady be cautioned
in some way ? She could hear a shout
even though we cannot see her. She cannot
yet be out of hearing ? " Paulton could
scarcely sit still in the boat.

"And suppose she could hear a shout,
sir, what could you tell her she doesn't
know ? Do you think Mrs. Davenport
has lived all these years and years a mile
from the Black Kock, and doesn't know

as much as any of us could tell her about
it ? Why, she lives nearer to it than anyone
else in the world ! Her next-door
neighbours are, I may say, the ghosts of
men who lost their lives on that very
spot."

'what is that you're saying?" asked
O'Brien, coming suddenly out of his
reverie.

"Only, sir, that Mrs. Davenport's next-door
neighbours are the ghosts of the
men who lost their lives on the Black
Rock."

O'Brien looked in amazement at the
boatman. He had been recalled from
his abstraction by the word " ghost ; "
but he had not fancied, when he asked
his question, that the answer would lie
so close to the thoughts which had been
occupying his mind a moment before.
For a while he could not clear his mind
of the effect of this coincidence.

What on earth do you know or guess
about the matter, Phelan?" he cried,
quite taken off his guard.

*' I suppose I know as much about the
Rock as any man of my years along the
coast," answered Phelan, with a slight
return of his former sullenness.

O'Brien at once saw that he had made
a mistake, that Phelan's words were perfectly
consistent with ignorance of what
he knew of the Fahey affair — or, indeed,
with the absence of intention to refer to
the Fahey affair. He hastened to put
himself right.

Of course you do, Phelan," said he
cordially. "No man knows more than
you. Excuse me for what I said. I was
thinking of something else when you
spoke, and I did not exactly hear what
you said. I did not mean to annoy you.
I was only stupid myself."

Jim Phelan considered this a very handsome

and ample apology, not only for
the words just then spoken, but for what
had occurred a few minutes before.

'' He was thinking, poor gentleman,"
thought Phelan, "of those blackguards
of Commissioners. I know how anxious
a man gets about fish."

"He was thinking," thought Alfred,
'' of Madge. I know all about that
kind of thing."

He had not been thinking of one or
the other. He was wondering how Mrs.
Davenport would have been affected if
the figure of Fahey suddenly rose before
her on that Kock.

"This, sir," said the boatman, addressing
Alfred, the stranger, "is what we call
the Ked Gap, and the cave beyond is
what we call the Eed Gap Cave — or the
Gap Cave, or the Eed Cave, for short."

Alfred looked around him, and then up.

Above towered the great perpendicular

cliffs, silent and forlorn. From the dark
green water at their bases, to the hard,
dark line they made against the azure
plain of sky that roofed the chasm, was
no break, in form or colour, no noteworthy
ledge or hollow, no clinging weeds
below or verdurous patch above. All was
smooth, and bluff, and huge, and liver-coloured.


A peculiar silence, a silence of a new
and startling quality, filled the gigantic
cleft. The silence abroad upon the sea
was that in which vast spaciousness engulfed
sound. Here adamantine walls,
beetling and threatening, a thousand feet
thick, stood between the stagnant air and
the large breathing of the sea. The
atmosphere was dense, motionless, inert
with salt vapours. The prodigious circumvallation
of cliff crushed vitality out of
the air. There was a breathless whisper
of water against the sea line of the

ramparts, and deep in the gorge of the
cave a smothered snore, like the hushed
breathing of some stupendous monster.

The yawl glided slowly up between the
closing walls of the Eed Gap. No one
spoke. The two boatmen were indifferent
to the place. O'Brien and Paulton were
lost in thoughts of diverse kinds, awakened
by the spectacle of Mrs. Davenport on the
Black Rock. None of the men was paying
attention to the Gap.

At last a sudden darkness fell upon the
boat. O'Brien and Paulton looked up.
The sky was no longer overhead. A gloom
of purple brown was above them. The
light of day stood like a lofty, luminous
pillar in their wake. They had entered
the Red Cave.

The boatmen ceased rowing, and Phelan
lit a torch.

For a few moments nothing could be
seen but the blazing red torch flare

VOL. III. M

against a vast black blank, and round
the glowing red boat a narrow pool of
glaring orange water.

No one moved. No sound informed the
silence but the hiss of the torch and
the profound sighs of distant, impenetrable
hollows.

The water illumined near the boat
looked trustworthy, denser than water,
a ruddy platform with shadowy verge.
No undulation moved over its face save
a dulling ripple caused by the boat's imperceptible
motion. The boat and figures
in it seemed the golden boss of a fiery
brazen shield hung in a night of
chaos.

Alfred Paulton put his hand outward
and downward. It touched the gleaming
surface of the water. He drew his hand
back with a start. The cold of the
water froze his fingers, his soul. The
water shone like solid metal, felt less

buoyant than the ruddy air he breathed.
Instead of resting on a firm plain of
luminous beaten gold, the boat hung on
a faint, thin fluid over a sightless abyss.

This was a terrible place. Here was
nothing but space for thought — for visions
and fears too awful to dwell upon.
Nothing was surer than that no loathsome
dangers lurked, or swam, or hung
pendulous above. Nothing was surer than
that the imagination crouched back
from dreads which had never affrighted
it before.

This water was only phantom water. It
was no better than the spume of sea-mists
held between invisible crags of
blackness, of mute eternity. If one should
fall out into that water, he would sink
through it swift as lead through air.
One would shoot down, and down, and
down, giddy, but not stunned. One
would sink — whither ? Whither ? To

H 2

what fell intimacy with dripping rocks
and clammy weeds and slime would one
come ? What agonising sense of impending
gloom reaching infinitely upwards
would lie upon one, as one fell ! Would
the falling ever cease ? Never, never.
Nor would one live, for to fall thus fora
moment of time would serve to fill
the infinite of eternity with chimeras of
ebon adamant too foul for human eyes.

The oars dipped. The boat moved
forward into the immeasurable vagueness
of shadow — into this sleeping chamber of
nio:ht. It glided over the silent floor
between hushed arras, which saw neither
the gaudy sun that drowns in light the
tender whisperings of the sea, nor the
silver moon that hearkens forlorn to the
faint complaining of the weary waves,
arras woven of the flame of earth's primal
fire, and limned by night in the smoke
of ancient chaos.

Something floated from the side of the
boat and shone a while in the wake, and
then was lost in the darkness as the boat
moved slowly on.

'keep her west'' whispered a voice
in the boat.

*' We're keeping west'* whispered another
voice in the boat. The noise of the oars
in the rowlocks clanked in the echoes
like the complaining of a gigantic wheel
whose bearings were dry. The whispers
came back from the echoes like the
whispers of a Titan whose teeth were
gone, and whose tongue was thick with
age or clumsy with disease. The voice
of the giant seemed near — on a level with
the head. It stirred the hair.

The torch went out.

"Light — give us light," whispered a
voice in the boat.

'' Wait. Watch astern," whispered
another voice.

"Astern' whispered the awful, almost
inarticulate voice close to the ear, in the
hair.

Then all was still. The oars stopped.
All eyes were, unseeing, turned in the
direction whence the boat had come. The
faintest glimmer indicated the opening to
the cave. All was black as the heart of
unhewn granite.

'now watch," whispered a voice in
the boat.

Now watch," whispered the echo
against the throat and neck.

*son no account start or stir. The
report will be very loud. Hold on to
the thwarts. I am going to fire ! "

Blended with the earlier portion of
this speech, the echoes gave back a
sharp battering sound like that of throwing
metal from a height. This was the
cocking of the gun.

When this sound ceased, the echo
whispered :

'fire!"

A jagged rod of flame and luminous
smoke shot outwards and upwards into
the black void from the boat aft, and
cleared the black space for a moment.

Then the clash and clangour of a
thousand shattered echoes close at hand
bore downward on the head and bent
the head, while out of far-reaching
caverns thunders were torn with shrieks
and yells and flung against concave-resounding
roofs, until the whole still
air of the monstrous hollows roared,
and secret ofi'-spring tombs of darkness,
never seen by man, answered with fearful
groans and shrieks of the Mother Cave.

Paulton let go the thwart, bent his
head, flung his arms up, and crossed
them over his head.

Here was the solid earth riven through
and through with prodigious thunders of
all the heavens !

The roar of sound fell to a shout, the
shout to a groan, the groan to a mutter.
Then all was still, stiller than before —
still with the silence of annihilation
accomplished. Nothing that had been
was. The echoes were dead, and would
speak no more. The material had failed
to be, and only darkness and the unweary
spirit of man remained.

A voice whispered, " Watch."

Some lingering phantom of an echo
whispered in ghostly gutturals, '* Watch ! '^

There was a hiss, a purple commotion
on the surface of the water, in the air on
the wake of the boat. A cone of intense
red flame, as thick as a man's arm, rose
up from the level of the water in the
wake, and stood a cubit high:

The air took fire and burned, and out

from the brown darkness leaned huge
polished pillars, copper-red, and broken
walls, smooth pilasters, and architraves
keen with light, and sightless gargoyles
blurred with fire, and cloisters whose rich
arches dripped with flame, and buttresses
with fierce outlines impacted on plutonian
shade, plinths with shafts of Moorish lightness
and arabesques with ruby tags, sturdy
bastions and flat curtains, broken Gothic
windows, capitals of acanthus leaves flushed
with ruddy flare.

Aloft yawned arches and domes and
hollow towers, vast in sombre distances
and sultry with hidden fires. The secrets
of their depths no eye could pierce. They
were abysmal homes of viewless voices —
homes of virgin night.

Hither and thither, chapels and aisles
and corridors and galleries, reached from
the great central space into the copper
gloom. Here above the surface of watery

floor stood columns of fallen pillars, masses
of broken walls, points of ruined spires.

In the centre of the level floor rose a
block of stone, flat, a little above the
surface of the water, and on this the headless
form of a colossal figure, showing in
rude outline like an Egyptian sphinx.

The ground was polished red granite
here and there, ribbed with ruby marble,
that shone with dazzling brightness against
the aqueous glare.

On the pedestal of the sphinx the men
of the boat landed, and stood to gaze
upon this Pompeii beneath Yesuvia's pall
this subterranean Venice in ruins — this
water-floored Heliopolis without the sun !

There was a loud hiss. The blood-red
architecture thrust forward in fiercer light.
A louder reverberating hiss, and all was
dark ! Everything had vanished — had
drawn back into immeasurable darkness.
The crimson light had burned down to

the level of the tiny raft which bore it,
and the water of the cave had quenched
its flame.

All was black darkness, turn which way
one might.

Light ! " whispered Paulton, overcome
by what he had heard and seen.

**\Yhat is that?" asked O'Brien, catching
Phelan's hand, and pointing down to
where the western gallery had glowed a
minute ago. Light was seen piercing the
cliff to the westward.

For a while no answer was given. Then,
in accents of awe and fear, the boatman
answered :

"A light — a light made by no mortal"
hand ! "

Far down in the gloom of the western
gallery a yellow spot shone !

A RETROSPECT.

Mrs. Davenport's visit to the Black
Rock that day had not been one of
mere curiosity, although nothing of import
to her life was likely to result from it.
Her career was over, if, indeed, it might
be said ever to have begun.

In her younger days she had been
abandoned by the only man she had ever
loved, and wed to a man whom she never
loved, whom she could not even esteem.
She had sworn to love her husband ; she
had fairly tried, and wholly failed. To
her husband she had been a blameless

wife, an admirable companion. He had
signified his approval of her conduct by
leaving her his fortune. All her lifetime
she had been too proud to care for
money, and now she could not take it.
Her father had prevented her marrying
the good-for-nothing, beggarly scamp, Tom
Blake, and forced her into the arms of
the elderly, rich, excellent Vir. Louis
Davenport. In those days she had been
torn by tempests of love and hate, of
aspirations and despairs, which no mortal
eye had seen, no mortal ear had heard.
In the solitude of her own room, and
of the woods about her father's home,
she had wept and stormed, and pitied
herself with the broken-hearted self-pity
of youth. She had cast herself against
the bars that confined her, and wished
that the fury which shook her might
end her. She had prayed in vain for
death. In answer to her passionate

appeals for a shroud, heaven sent her a
bridal veil. When Blake gave her up,
she did not care whether she walked
into an open grave or up to the marriage
altar. She took no interest in herself
: why should she take interest in anyone
else ?

If Blake had asked her to fly with
him then, she would have rushed into
his arms with unspeakable eagerness and
joy. But he sold his claim to her fora
sum of money, and walked off with
the cash in his pocket !

She then knew she was beautiful — one
of the most beautiful women in the
country. Many men had sought her
before Blake asked her for her love. But
up to his coming she was heart-whole.
She had never seriously considered any
man. She thought little of the sex, of
the race, herself included. She took buta
weak interest in this world, and, up to

the advent of her only sweetheart, would
have stepped out of it any day without
much reluctance. She was a dreamer, and
told herself the hero of her dreams was
not human. Then came Tom Blake, and
forth went her whole heart to him. She
gave him all the love she had to give.
She told him her life had hitherto been
dull, without expectation, hope, love, sunlight
; but that, as he was now with her,
and would, in spite of all opposition, be
beside her all her life, her soul was filled
with ineffable hope, with delicious love,
and the dream-romance of her life had
taken substantial form, which would bea
thousand times sweeter than she had
ever dared to figure in her thoughts.

Her lover had no money. He had lost
his patrimony. Her father had nothing to
give her, and

And what ?

How was it to be ? How could they

live on nothing ? She had been brought
sup a lady, but her father was hopelessly
in debt — over head and ears in debt — and
if he were ever so willing to do so, he
was powerless to help them now, and could
leave them nothing later.

True — most sadly true. But what of
that ? Was Tom not her lover ? — and was
he going to die of hunger ? Did he not
think he could get enough money somehow
to keep him from falling by the way ?

No doubt. But she had been tenderly,
luxuriously brought up. He had no means
of keeping her in any such position as she
had all along in life enjoyed.

But he could get bread ? Not literally
only bread, but as much as they paid a
gamekeeper or a groom ?

Oh, nonsense ! Of course he could.
But gentlefolk could not live on the
wages of a gamekeeper or a groom.

Did he love her ?

Very much. But a gamekeeper got no
more

Than a roof, and clothes, and food,
and — love. How much did he love her?

Oh, better than anything else in the
world.

Well, then, let him take time and look
around him, and get house, and clothes,
and food such as gamekeepers and grooms
may have. Those would: be his contributions
to their lives. She would supply
the love.

But lady and gentleman could not live
in such a way.

Why not ? He was a gentleman, and
she was a lady, and poverty could take
none of these poor possessions away, anymore
than riches could create them.
Let him get a gamekeeper's wages, and
she would share them with him, and give
him all her love, every day renewed.

But

VOL. III. N

Ah! Then all she had to give was
not worth as much to him as a gamekeeper
valued his own wife at. Good-bye.
The air was damp, and this wood was
chilly.

Yes, it looked as if it were going to
rain. She would not leave him thus.
She would say good-bye to him, and give
him one kiss at parting.

She would say good-bye, and he might
have as many kisses as he cared for,
provided she got soon away — for it was
going to rain. No man had ever kissed
her but him. Kisses did not mean anything,
or words either. Why did he drawback?
She told him he might kiss her
if he chose. Any man might kiss her
now. Kisses or words did not mean anything.
Well, good-bye. Whither was he
going? It would surely rain. Whither,
did he say?

''To hell!"

'* No, not there. You are a gentleman,
and gentlemen do not go there ; only
gamekeepers and grooms — and women such
as I."

She walked slowly away through the
moist wood in the drizzling rain.

He felt sorely sorry and hurt, and ill-used
by fate ; but he had a gay
disposition, and was no dreamer. Besides,
he was a man of the world, and devilishly
pressed for money just then ; so he took
Louis Davenport's thousand pounds and
went away.

After a while she married the odd,
rich, old bachelor, Louis Davenport (she
did not care what man kissed her now),
and he took her away to Kilcash House,
and although he never laid anv restraint
upon her, she knew he did not care
that she should go much abroad; so she
lived almost wholly in the house, and

N 2

rarely went out alone, and never had
any guest at the place.

Mr. Davenport was at home most of
the time. Now and then he went away
for a few days, and always came back
alone. There were no callers at the
house, and she at first hoped she might
die, and when she found her bodily
health unimpaired, looked forward with
a sense of relief to the time when she
should go mad.

Still her mental health held out as well
as her bodily health, and weeks grew
into months, and found no change in
her or her manner of life.

But there came a slight change in
her home. During the first few weeks
of her married life no stranger ever crossed
the threshold of Kilcash House.

Now a tall, gaunt, humble-mannered
man, of slow, soft speech and unpretending
ways, was often with Mr.

Davenport for a long time in the day,
sometimes far into the night, The
husband never took the wife into his
business confidence, and the wife had
no curiosity whatever. But from odd
words she gathered that this young
man, whose name was Michael Fahey,
depended on her husband, and was
helped and received by him because of
some old ties between the families of
both. She heard Fahey was staying at
the village of Kilcash for his health,
which was delicate, and that he was
completely trustworthy and well-disposed
towards Mr. Davenport.

All this reached Mrs. Davenport without
leaving any impression whatever on her
mind beyond the simplest value of the
words. Her husband introduced Fahey
to her as a man in whom he took a
sincere interest, and whom he wished
her to think well of. Whether he

intended his wife should or should not
treat the stranger as an equal, she did
not know, she did not care.

For a time she took little heed of
Fahey, but gradually it dawned upon
her that in him she had a new admirer.
She was accustomed to admiration,
surfeited with it. Her love romance
was at an end. She was married to a
man for whom she did not care, from
whom she did not shrink, to whom she
owed no ill-will, who was in his poor,
narrow, selfish way good and kind to
her. If she had now any commerce
with laughter, she would have laughed ;
but even the pathetically absurd experience
she had had of love could not provoke
a smile, and she simply took no heed,
said no word, gave no sign. She did not
feel angry, flattered, amused, even bored.
She was past any of these emotions now.

She would, she could be no more than
indifferent.

Nothing could be more respectful than
Fahey's manner. He did not regard her
as human. He worshipped her afar
off. He ate his heart in silence. He
breathed no word, no sigh, gave wilfully
no sign. But she saw his downcast or
averted face, and she read the homage
in furtive glances of his wondering eyes.

Then came the scene with the rose and
her husband's absence abroad, followed
by his return, and a brief history of the
marvellous escape he had from that
French bank, and his resolution that he
would now settle down in life and
speculate no more. She then had but a
dim idea of what speculation meant, of
what his business was.

Soon came a day of mystery and horror
to her.

She was alone in the little sitting-room
on the ground floor, purely her own. It
faced west. Broad daylight flooded the
garden before her, the rolling downs
beyond.

Suddenly the light of the window by
which she sat was obscured. The window
was opened by Fahey. She motioned him
to enter. By way of reply he made an
impatient gesture.

*sis he in ? " asked Fahey, breathlessly.

''No," she answered. "Can I do anything
for you?"

She now saw he was in violent agitation,
and physically distressed.

He continued :

"I have not a moment to spare. Say
to him, ' All is well. All is safe for him.'
I have arranged that."

Safe I " she answered. " Does any
danger threaten my husband?"

*' Yes, while I am here — while I live."

You — you would not hurt him ? "

She remembered the look of admiration
she had seen in this man's eyes, and rose
and recoiled in horror.

"Give him my message. Repeat all I
have said, except this : ' I am not doing it
for his sake, or my own sake, but for yours.
Good-bye.' Tell no one else of my being
here ; no one but him — not a soul."

In a moment he was gone.

The next thing she heard of him was
that he had drowned himself in the hideous
Puffing Hole.

At first she had been inclined to think
Fahey's words referred solely to his feelings
towards her ; but when she learned he had
drowned himself she doubted this. Against
what was her husband secure ? To say
he was secure against Fahey's admiration
for her would be the height of gratuitous
absurdity. She cared no more for the
young man than for any misty figure ina

fable. He must be mad ; yes, that was
it. That supposition made all simple —
explained everything.

It was night when her husband returned.
She, remembering Fahey's caution, and
bearing in mind that walls have ears went
to the gate of the grounds, and there met
Davenport. He had heard of Fahey's fate.
It was dark — pitch dark — when she gave
him the message with which she had been
charged.

Poor Michael ! " her husband said —
"poor Michael! Unfortunate fellow!"

He said no more then, and rarely spoke
of the man afterwards. Davenport was
not a communicative man, and there was
nothing noteworthy in his silence.

After her husband's death she went
through his papers, and found evidence
of a much closer intimacy between Fahey
and him than she had till then suspected.
There was no clear evidence in these documents.

They were partly in her husband's
handwriting, partly in Fahey's. There was
an air of mystery in them, and she was
certain many passages of them were figurative.
But one dreadful secret she learned
from them beyond all doubt : Louis Davenport
had not come by his money fairly,
and Fahey was an accomplice in his
schemes. When leaving London for the
Continent, she had carried those papers
with her unread. There she opened them,
with a view to destroying them, and burned
them in terrified haste. She had never
suspected her husband of dishonest actions.
Now she felt perfectly sure he had come
by his money foully. How, she did not
know. The man had been her husband,
and she would shield his memory from
shame ; but she would touch none of his
money, let who would have it, when she
got back to London.

She was convinced Fahey had not

thrown himself into the Puffing Hole for
love of her, or because he was insane,
but solely and simply because he and her
husband were mixed up in crimes of some
kind, and Fahey preferred death to discovery
on his own part, and on her part
too ; for she would suffer from the exposure
of her husband, and Fahey had nothing
to expect from her. There was still a
want of clearness and precision about the
whole affair. But on her way back from
France, she had no doubt her theory was
right in the main.

Before the inquest she had been in
horror of revealing in court the history of
the treatment she had received at the
hands of Blake, and the bare notion that
she, being then a married woman, had
driven this man Fahey in a frenzy of
self-sacrifice or devotion to drown himself,
filled her mind with thoughts of shame
and anguish, the contemplation of which

nearly took away her own reason. She
had contemplated making away with herself
rather than face the ordeal of the
court. She had been a recluse for years,
and haughty in her consciousness of un-amiableness
all her life.

On her return to London she heard the
rumour of this apparition at the Puffing
Hole. Phelan had told of the apparition
to several people in Kilbarry. The news
of it had got into the local papers, and
London papers copied the account. Xo
name was given but Fahey's, and attached
to his name was a brief history of Fahey's
disappearance years ago.

Upon these two discoveries she resolved
to go to Ireland and renounce all claim
to the fortune her husband had left her.
There could no longer be in her mind
any doubt that her husband's fortune, ora
portion of it, had been obtained by
fraud. At Paulton's she met O'Brien,

who, on the way to Ireland, told her he
himself had seen Fahey.

She was now quite sure Fahey was
still alive. The horrible suspicion had
taken hold of her mind that Fahey had,
after keeping in hiding for years, poisoned
her husband for her sake ! In the light
of her belief that Fahey still lived, the
theory that her husband had poisoned
himself while of unsound mind was absurd
to her.

Before setting out this day for the
Black Rock she opened a drawer of her
late husband's, took out a revolver she
knew to be loaded, and dropped it into
her pocket.

When she left the edge of the Black
Rock she walked carefully to the cliff
and ascended by the path.

When she reached the level of the
downs she gazed round.

She started. A loud explosion rose

from beneath her feet. It was the gunfire
of the boat and the tremendous
reverberations from the caves and cliffs.

She looked round in alarm. A minute
ago she had been alone. Now Michael
Fahey stood by her side !

A LAST APPEAL.

Michael Fahey ! Michael Fahey ! "
cried Mrs. Davenport, slowly. " Am I
awake and sane ? "

"Both," answered he, gently. "You
are awake and sane, and I am Fahey,
and alive. Nothing can be more incredible
; but it is as I say, Mrs. Davenport.
You will not betray me ? You
will not be unmerciful to me ? Remember,
I never meant to do you harm."

She shrank back from him. Did this
man, whose hands were reddened with
her husband's blood, dare to plead to her

for mercy. " Betray you ! AVhat do you
mean ? Do you call it betraying you to
give you into the hands of justice ? You
will gain nothing by threats. I am not
afraid of you ; and I am not defenceless,
even though I am alone." She moved
further off, and pressed the revolver in
her hand.

He seemed dejected rather than alarmed.
'' What good can it do you ? When I
disappeared years ago, it was for the

good of your husband " He held

out his hands appealingly to her.

Her tone and attitude were firm, as she
interrupted him. 'you disappeared years
ago for the good of my husband, and reappear
for his death — for his murder ! I
can have no more words v^ith you. I
shall certainly not shield you from the
consequences of your crime."

If you only knew me as well as you
might — if you could only understand how

VOL. III.

I felt that day I was hunted like a beast,
you could not believe I would willingly
do anything to annoy, much less to harm
you. . . . Mrs. Davenport," he burst out,
vehemently, '' I would have died then for
you : I will die now if you bid me — die
for that second rose''

She looked at him with a glance of
loathing, and gathered herself together as
though she felt contaminated b}^ contact
with the air he breathed.

"Go away at once. Your audacity
is loathsome. Has it come to this with
me, that I must bandy words with such a
monster ? "

•' Mrs. Davenport," said he, in a tone
of expostulation, ''I am very far from
saying I am blameless. I have committed
crimes for which the punishment would
be great, but I was not alone in my
crimes. I dict not invent them."

'sand who invented the atrocious crime

of last February ? Who was in our house
in Dulwich that night?"

I read the case, and saw that Mr.
Thomas Blake was at your house on that
night."

And where were you ? "

In Brussels. Good heavens ! — you
cannot imagine I had anything to do
with that awful night ! The idea is too
monstrous to resent — to think of for a
moment. I swear to you I was in Brussels
at the time, and that I never did, or
thought of doing, any injury to your
husband. I loved him well; but I loved
some one else better-better than all the
world besides."

He did not look at her, but kept his
eyes fixed on the sea.

She moved as if to go.

He heard the motion, and went to her
and stood between her and the house.

I will not say another word about

o 2

myself; but hear me out. If I have
nothing to hope for, let me go away in
the belief I am not unjustly suspected
by you of hurting your husband. I never
cared much for my life. Let me feel
that when I die I shall not be worse in
your eyes than I deserve to be. Mrs.
Davenport, hear me."

He entreated her with his voice, with
his eyes, with his bent body, with his
outstretched hands.

Without speaking, she gave him to
understand he might go on.

^'I knew Mr. Davenport years before
I saw you. I had business connections
with him which would not bear the light.
You must have heard or guessed something
of what we have been busy
about ? "

She made no sign — said nothing.

'*I was a steel engraver. Now and

then lie wanted plates done. I did the
plates for him."

^'AVhat kind of plates?"

She betrayed no emotion of any kind.
Her voice was as calm as though she
was asking an ordinary question.

"You had better not know. It would
do you no good to know. But do you
believe me that I was hundreds of miles
away from London that awful night ? "

*sand what brought you back to this
place now ? "

I came back — because you are free ! "

She made a gesture of impatience and
dissent.

"You do not mean to say you will
continue your suspicion in the face of
my denial, in the face of my horror at
the mere thought?"

"But why should I take your unsupported
word ? If you are innocent,

why were you so horrified at the mere
thought of inquiry ? "

But, good heavens ! Mrs. Davenport,
you did not for a moment imagine I was
afraid of inquiry into anything which
occurred in February ? I thought the
inquiry to which you referred had
reference to some old transactions between
me and Mr. Davenport ? "

What were these transactions ? "
'' I beg of you not to ask. "What good
can it do to go into matters so far back ?
You would find my answers of no advantage
to you."

** Were they of a business character ? "
Purely of a business character, I assure

you."

** And they would not bear the light ? '^
*' Not with advantage to me."
** Or to my husband ? "
*' Or with advantage to your late
husband."

And to you, and to you alone the
secret of these transactions is now known ? "

*' To me, and to me alone."

She paused in thought. She held up her
hand to bespeak his silence. After a few
moments' pause, she said :

*' In the course of these transactions
injury was done to some one ? Was that
not so ? "

'you are asking too much. Neither
your happiness nor your fortune could be
served by my answering your questions. I
refuse to answer."

With a gesture, she declined to be
satisfied with this treatment.

'' I have no fortune and no happiness.
Once you told me you would do anything I
requested of you if I gave you a rose.
There are no roses now. In all likelihood
there will be no more roses while I
live "

'while you live!"

*let me go on. I have not much to
say. You could not prize a rose for its
intrinsic value ? "

No ; but for two other considerations —
for the fact that it had once been yours,
and for what the gift of it from you to me
might signify. '^

"If I gave you a rose now it could
signify nothing — mind, absolutely nothing.
But if the mere fact that it belonged to me
would make anything valuable in your
eyes, I will give you my glove, or my
bracelet, or this for your secret ; " and she
drew from her pocket the revolver and
pointed it at him.

He started towards her at the sight of
the weapon, crying angrily :

What do you mean by carrying that ?
Great heavens, it cannot be that you came
out here with the intention of committing
suicide ! "

He looked at her in horror.

No' she answered quietly — " but with
the intention of defending myself against
you. I thought if I should meet you,
and you had murdered my husband, and
knew from me I had guessed it, that I
might need this. But I have no evidence
you did murder him, and I see no sign
of guilt in you. Will you take it, or the
bracelet, or the glove, or all three, and
tell me about those transactions in
which my husband was engaged with
you ? "

'rit is not enough for my secret," he
said.

What more do you want ? My
purse ? "

She put those questions in a placid
tone, and showed no impatience or scorn.

"No," he said, shaking with conflicting
passions, '' I do not want your purse. If
I wanted money, I could have had as
much as any man could care for out of

your husband's purse. I have enough for
myself. You cured me of the love of
money, and put another love in its place.
Give me your hand, or fire."

She raised her hand quickly, and flung
the revolver from her over the cliff. It
fell on the Black Kock beneath. The
fall was followed by a long silence on
both sides.

I make one last appeal to you," she
cried in soft, supplicating tones — 'one
last appeal. I do not purpose keeping
a penny of the money — not one farthing.
Some papers which fell accidentally into
my hands after my husband's death convinced
me he came by his money
dishonestly. He himself told me you
had been of great service to him, and that
your actions would not bear the light.
Give me, for pity's sake, a chance of
restoring this money to those who ought
to have it. I did think of dying and

shielding his memory, for if I died no
one could be surprised at my leaving the
wretched money to charities. But it
would be better still to give what remains
of the money to the rightful owners.
Will you tell me who they are ? "

She caught his hand in hers and drew
it towards her.

He seized hers eagerly, and held it.

*'I will for this," he whispered. *' We
can give all his money back if you
will."

She snatched her hand away.

"That is impossible, sir. I have told
you so finally."

She essayed to pass by him once more.

"Only a minute. I cannot live openly
in this country; I must go abroad. I
have been concealed close to this place
in the hope of meeting you. I may
never see you again. Do not go for a
minute. Your husband was always good

and loyal to me, and I was always loyal
to him. He dealt honourably with mein
money matters. It was necessary for
us to have a hiding-place near this, and
I found it. Just before I disappeared he
made up his mind to abandon business
of all kinds. He had enough of money,
and so had I — though of course he was
a rich man compared with me. Well, as
you know, I disappeared. I went, no
matter where. I disappeared because I
had no longer any business here, and
because of another reason to which I will
not again refer. That is all I have to
say, except that I left documents which
would be intelligible to your husband —
they contained the clue to our hiding-place
should I die or your husband want
it— in Mr. John O'Hanlon's hands for
Mr. Davenport and you. Nothing, I
suppose, ever reached you about them ? "
''No."

"That, then, is all I have to say."

You will tell me no more ? Give meno
key ? "

"Mr. Davenport left you his money.
Why should I help you to get rid of it ?
Good-bye."

He turned eastward, went along the
cliff, and she moved off slowly in the
direction of Kilcash House.

BEYOND THE VEIL.

It was Phelan who said it was not the
hand of mortal man that had kindled
the fire the four men in the Bed Cave
saw after the dying of the red light on
the water.

For a long time after he had spoken
no human voice was heard. All was
silence save the mystic whispers and
breathing of the cave, which, after the
prodigious clangour lately filling the void,
were no more than the ripple of faint
air flowing through mere night.

The three men watched the light

breathlessly. At first it seemed steady,
but now it began to waver slowly this
way and that way, like a warning hand
admonishing or threatening, a spiritual
hand beckoning or blessing.

It was not crimson, as the other flame
had been, but pale yellow, like the early
east. It was not fierce and dazzling, but
lambent and soft. It was not light in
darkness, as a zenith moon, but light
against darkness, as a setting star. It
was independent, absolute, taking or
giving nothing. Space lay between it and
the eyes that saw ; infinity between it and
the sightless vault.

There was something in this cave that
killed you, and yet in that ]Aside you
must not die.

Heaven be merciful to us ! " whispered
a human voice.

"To us," whispered the phantom voice
against the men's hair.

It's the corpse-candle of the dead men
of the Black Kock," whispered Phelan.

'' Of the Black Kock ! " echoed the spirit.

The words 'black Rock" acted like a
charm, and broke the terrible spell of the
place. Never before had the name of
that fatal and hated shelf of land sounded
grateful to human ears.

The two boatmen had been often in
that stupendous cave before, had seen its
colossal glories in the ruby flare, and
heard its reverberating thunders in the
inexorable gloom. But never until now
had they gazed upon this weird light ; they
were certain that if it had existed when
they had been visitors on other occasions
they could not have missed observing it.

What they now saw made a profound
impression on them, and powerfully excited
their superstitious minds. They had never
rowed to the end of that eastern shaft of
the labyrinth, but they knew from the

sharp turn it struck west, and the great
depth to which it penetrated, that the
onward limit of it must be near the rear
of the Black Rock.

This filled them with doubt — uneasy
doubt. Owing to the darkness and the
nature of the remote light, they could
not form an exact notion of its position,
but they guessed it to be no less thana
mile from the Ked Gap, and, allowing
for everything, that would be the back
of the Black Kock.

Why should there be a light at the
back of the Black Kock ? How could a
light be accounted for there ? except it
was a corpse-candle on that murderous
reef.

It was a thought to shudder at.

With the other two men the effect was
wholly different. Neither had ever been
in this marvellous place before ; neither
had seen its sights, or heard its sounds,

VOL. III. p

or endured its darkness until now, and their
imaginations had been powerfully excited
and exercised. At one time they were
exalted by the visible — at another overawed
by the unseen. Sobriety of thought
and familiarity of experience were absent,
and they were face to face with things
undreamed of and enormous, and with
phantoms and monstrous ideas that baffled
investigation and pursuit.

But to them the mention of the Black
Rock meant the re-entry of ordinary ideas
and homely thoughts. It lay out therein
the noonday sunlight beside the sunlit
sea. It was part of the pastoral land
where people sang and trees waved their
leaves and winds bore perfumes. There
was nothing more disquieting about it
than about a ship, or a house, or a rampart.

O'Brien's thoughts had now gone back
to their ordinary course. If this light came
from anywhere near the Black Rock, might

it not have something to do with the
Puffing Hole?

The question was fascinating, alluring.
It might prove a beacon to discovery.

Where do you think it is from,
Phelan ? " he asked, in a whisper.

Somewhere near the Black Rock. I
can't say exactly where."

'what do you believe it is?"

''A corpse-candle. The corpse-candle of
the men that the Rock killed."

'•■ Nonsense ! You ought to know better.
A corpse-candle is not for the dead — it's
for the living."

"Above ground it may be so. But
under ground it may be different."

"Let us go and see what it is."

"Not a stroke."

What, Phelan ! — afraid again ? There's
hardly a thing you are not afraid of"

I'm not afraid of you or any other

man."

p 'A

'' If you don't go to it with me, I'll swim
to it."

"If you do, it will be your corpse-candle."


*' I don't care. If you won't go, I'll
swim to it. If you don't make up your
mind while I'm counting twenty, I'll dive
off and swim."

'rit would be murder to let you, O'Brien.
Put it out of your head. We won't let
you go."

None of the men could see where another
was standing.

O'Brien laughed.

"You can't touch me — you can't stop
me."

Whisht — whisht ! For heaven's sake,
don't laugh. This is no place for laughing
with that candle before you."

O'Brien laughed softly, and counted,
"One''

If you laugh again, by heavens, I'll
throw you in, O'Brien."

'' Two ! " O'Brien laughed. " Then you
won't let me count twenty? You launch
me on my swim at * three ' ? "

*' He'll bring the cliffs down on us."

"Four! Ha, ha, ha!"

Up to this the words and the laughter
had been in whispers. This time O'Brien
counted and laughed out loud.

The effect was prodigious. Those vast
chambers of solemn night had never before
heard human laughter, and they roared
and bellowed, and yelled and shrieked,
and grumbled, as though furiously calling
upon one another to rush together and
tear asunder or crush flat the impious
intruders who dared to profane with such
sounds the sanctuary of their repose.

'Til go," whispered Phelan— '^'11 go.
But— wait ! "

A torch was now lit, and by the aid of
its fitful flame the four men scrambled
into the yawl. The two rowers took their
places standing and facing the bow.
O'Brien held the flaring torch on high,
and the boatmen gave way.

As they glided gently along, the irregular
walls of the aisle came nearer to them
out of the darkness with a nearness that
was sinister and hateful. It was as though
they crept close with the full intention
of crushing the craft and grinding the men
to death between their ponderous fangs
and molars. They seemed avengers of
the echoes outraged by the laughter.

The luminous shaft still shone ; but as
they came nearer, the light grew whiter
and less like flame. The red glare of
the torch seemed to overcome it. •

The men snatched it with starting
eyes.

The walls of the cave came closer out
of the darkness, and the roof lowered.

By this time Phelan had lost all his
fears, and was as curious as the others to
know what the light was.

All at once he cried out — '' Ease ! "

Both men stopped rowing. The sound
of the oars ceased, and the noise of the
ripple from the oars. All listened intently*
A hissing sound could be distinctly heard
a loud hissing sound which they had
not noticed before, because, no doubt, of
the graduates of their approach and
the noises made by the rowers.

"It's water — falling water. But, in the
name of all the saints, where is it falling
from, and how can we see it in the darkness
? Give way, Tim."

The cave grew narrower still, and now
there was barely room for the shortened
oars. The sides of it came closer, the

roof lowered until it was no more than
an arm's length above the heads of the
standing men. The bright patch grew
higher and broader. The torch still burned.
A dull whiteness shone on the rocks.

The luminous space now looked like a
faintly-lighted sheet of glass. The hissing
sound of the water had gathered intensity.


"I don't know what's beyond, but I'll
risk going through if you are willing,"
cried Phelan, who was now in a state of
almost frenzy from suppressed excitement.

Go on — go on ! " shouted O'Brien, who
found it difficult to keep from jumping
overboard.

Go on ! " repeated Alfred, who, too,
was now standing up.

Give way with a will ! " shouted
Phelan ; and in a minute the boat shot
through a thick sheet of foam and falling
water, and glided into a placid pool.

For a moment the men were blinded
by the foam and water, and could see
nothing.

They rubbed their eyes, looked up
obliquely, and were blinded once again.

The mid-day sun flamed above their
heads at the end of a stupendous tube.

An indescribable cry arose. Then all
was still.

A crow flew between them and the sun.
All bent their heads and crouched low
as though instant death was rushing down
upon them. The crow went by harmlessly.


'* Do you know where we are ? " asked
Phelan, in the voice of an awestruck child.

"No."

At the bottom of the shaft of the old
mine. It slants to the southward, and
that's the sun!"

They looked around : some wreckage
floated on one side of the boat.

The planks that covered the mouth of
the shaft. They must have fallen in."

Something that was not a plank floated
on the other side of the boat.

It was the body of Fahey !

AN EVENING WALK.

Yes, Madge, 'twas an awful time. I
never felt anything like it in my life ;
and as for Alfred, he was stunned with
terror. You see, that old mine shaft had
followed the soft part of the cliff (there's
not much use in looking for copper in
solid sandstone), and so was like a huge
telescope, pointed south at some angle or
other — the angle, I think, at which you
are now holding your chin."
Jerry, don't talk nonsense."
You'd be very sorry indeed if I didn't.
Well, we hauled the dreadful thing we had

found into the boat, and then began to
think of getting back; but Phelan, the
boatman, swore he would not go through
that awful Red Cave with it on board.

'ewe looked round us to see the best
thing we could do. We found we were
in what I may call an under-ground pool,
from which there were three ways out —
one leading into the cliff, one leading in
the direction of the sea, and the one by
which we bad entered. Am I tiring you
with my long-winded description ? "

*' No, Jerry — go on ; I came out to hear
all," said Madge, pressing the arm on
which her own rested.

We first tried the way towards the
sea, and found, to Phelan's amazement
and consternation, that it led right under,
or, rather, through the Puffing Hole. No
power on earth could induce Phelan to
go that way. When we made this discovery,
I now plainly saw the meaning

of those mysterious measurements and
instructions left by the unfortunate Fahey,
and the means by which he had effected
his extraordinary disappearance years ago.
He had jumped doNvn and swum inward
to where we had found his dead body.
In his * Memorandum,' 'Else 15.6 lowest'
meant what I had expected — the rise of
the lowest tide. 'At lowest minute of
lowest forward with all midst undaunted,'
meant that one entering at the Whale's
Mouth at the lowest minute of the lowest
tide was to push forward with all
vigour. . . . But, Madge darling, this
must bore you to death ? "

"No, Jerry, I love to hear it. Just
fancy having the hero of such an adventure
telling it quietly to me on the
Dulwich Road ! "

Twenty years hence how sick you'll
be of these same adventures ! You will
then have heard them told at least a thousand

times to every fresh acquaintance I
make — man, woman, or child. But you'll
be very tired of me also, sweetheart, and
you shall go to sleep in an easy-chair
while I prate on'

"Don't say such horrid things, or I
shall cry. Please go on."

''Ah, well, you may bully me now, but
you won't then. Where did I leave off,
darling ? " He pressed her arm and she
pressed his.

"At the man going up under the Puffing
Hole. The paper he left with your
solicitor."

Our solicitor — say our solicitor."

Our solicitor. There ! But how tiresome
you are ! "

Oh, ay ! I have the whole thing off
by heart. The ' Memorandum ' goes on,
'The foregoing refers to s-c-u-1-l-s with
only one s-k-u-1-1 any lowest, or any last
quarter, but great forward pluck required

for this. In both cases (of course !) left.'
You see, here he underlines the words
sculls ' and ' skull,' which shows something
unusual was meant. Remembering
everything, ' sculls ' evidently meant
sculls, as very few people have more than
one skull, and ' skull ' meant what it
seems to mean — your head. By-the-way,
I beg your pardon. It's only men have
skulls, not angels.'

'^ Jerry, I'm going home."

"Well, I won't, I won't! Put your
arm back. Let us, in fact, have an armed
peace."

This kind of thing, Jerry, is very
bitter, and I feel as if — as if— as if "

'' As if what ? "

'* As if I can't help liking you — sometimes
when you're nice."

"I'll be good and nice. Well, what
he meant was that when you wanted to
get at his hiding-place by the sea, in a

boat pulling sculls, you came and did
certain things ; and that when you wanted
to get there by jumping down the Puffing
Hole, you did other things.

"When we came back to the foot of
the shaft the sun had gone off it, and it
was comparatively dark. We tried the
passage leading inward, and here we found
Fahey's hiding-place. It was a small low
cave, with a rocky ledge about as wide
as the footway we are walking on. . . .
Madge, are those new boots? They look
new. I wonder did I ever tell you I
think you have awfully pretty feet."
"I give you up. You are incorrigible."
'ras I was saying, we found a ledge
of rock about as broad as your foot.
This was Fahey's retreat, and here were
all the materials used by the forgers of
bank-notes. How Fahey got them there
unobserved is the puzzle. He must have
brought them piecemeal Here, beyond

all doubt, were printed the notes forged
upon the bank of Bordelon and Company,
of Paris, by means of which Mr. Davenport
stole a colossal fortune.

Here we found an explanation of how
Fahey's suit of clothes lasted ten or
twelve years. We found two suits precisely
similar. He kept one to wear, no
doubt, while the other was drying. There
was a place which had evidently been
used as a fireplace, and although there
was water so close to this ledge, it was
above the highest reach of the highest
tide, and dry as tinder. The dryness of
the place and the salt of the sea-water
had preserved these clothes from decay,
while most of the metal things had
crumbled into dust.

"He must have discovered this place
in his boat, and after that found out
the shaft of the mine communicated with
the whole cavernous system, which is so

VOL. Ill, ^

vast as to stagger the mind. Thus he
had two means of gaining his retreat;
and when he said he had lost his boat,
she was safely moored in the cave incase
of emergency — for we found the
painter-chain hanging from a bolt."

'but what of that light you saw that
turned out to be water ? And did the
miners work in the sea ? "

*' Attentive and intelligent darling, I
thank thee. The theory is that Fahey,
in falling or sliding down the shaft, struck
the western wall of the pool in which we
found him, and brought down a huge mass
of clay which was ripe for falling, or that
it had fallen recently, or that our gunshot
had brought it down. The curtain of
water was formed by a spring of freshwater.
There are always dozens of such
springs in cliffs. As to the foot of the
shaft, the explanation is that at the time
the miners were at work the sea had not

eaten so far inward. In fact, that whole
district is and has been gradually so
enormously undermined, that soon a
mighty subsidence must take place."

But you say that the hole down to
the mine slanted. How did he get up
and down ? It would have been barely
possible, but dangerous, to crawl up."

He had a rope by which to hold on,
and while holding on thus, he could walk
upright — that is, hand over hand. Before
the fall of the planks that covered the top
of the shaft, Fahey had crept out by a
small opening looking seaward, and concealed
from view, if any one ever should
be so foolhardy as to go there, by a thick
growth of furze."

Well, what did you do afterwards ? "

'' When ? "

You told me only as far as coming
back from the Puffing Hole."

"True. Well, we laid what remained

q2

of the unfortunate man on the rock which
had often been his resting-place before,
and then rowed back through the wonderful
Eed Cave, and put the matter in the
hands of the police. At the inquest all
about the forgery of Davenport and Fahey
and the swindle on the Paris bank came
out, and Mrs. Davenport was examined,
She admitted Fahey had made love to her,
as you saw by the papers. Wasn't it
strange that Alfred should be the first to
see her husband and her husband's partner
in guilt dead, and not by natural means,
and that at both inquests she spoke of a
new lover, and that Alfred, the newest
lover of all three, should have been at
both inquests ? "

^' It is astonishing and terrible. I
wonder what will come of it ? "

Heaven knows. But there, let it go
now, Madge. When you come to Ireland,

love, you shall see those wonderful
caves."

*' I'd rather die," she said, "than go
near them."

"What!— if they were lit by the
glorious effulgence of this splendid
specimen of the O'brien ? "

This dialogue took place one day after
dinner in the June following the visit to
the cave. The villainous Fishery Commissioners
had been overcome, and Jerry
and Madge were to be married in a
week.

Alfred Paulton was still at the " Strand
Hotel," in the village of Kilcash.

CONCLUSION.

Marion, will you not listen to me ? —
will you not listen to reason ? Your
fortune, you say, is now all gone — must
be restored to its lawful owners, the Paris
bankers, and that you have made the
necessary arrangements for doing so.
You are bankrupt in fortune : why should
you be bankrupt also in love ? "

Understand me, Thomas Blake, I will
speak on this subject no more to you.
I do not think you will have the bad

taste to remain any longer in this house
when I ask you to go."

*' I will do anything on earth for you,
Marion — anything in reason you ask me."

"Then go."

But is that reasonable ? Is it reasonable
to ask me to leave you now that
you are as free as you were in the
olden times ? "

She looked at him wrathfully, scornfully.



Have you got a second bidder for mein
view ? Did you not take my heart when
it was young, when you were young, and
sell it for a sum of money down ? You
know there is no one in this house but
servants. Save yourself the ignominy of
my ringing the bell. Sir, will you go ?
I have affairs to attend to. You have
broken your promise by renewing this
subject."

"Why did you telegraph for me to
London ? "

Because I thought you might be useful
to me, and you have proved useless."

"And if I had proved useful, would
you have rewarded me ? "

"Yes."

"Oh, Marion, Marion, you are playing
with me ! Do you mean to say you
would have allowed me to hope if I had
proved of service in that affair ? I did my
best. 1 swear to you I did my best,
and if you will only give me your hand
now "

Thomas Blake, I would have rewarded
you by saying that your debt to me
had been diminished by one useful act
of yours. But my contempt for you
would have been just the same. Take
your elderly protestations of love to fresh
ears. Mine are too old and too weary,

and too well acquainted with their value,
to care much for them. Go now. When
I have need of you again I shall send
for you."

"Marion, this is too bad. You are
treating me as if I were a dog."

Worse — much worse. We were intended
for one another. Once I would
have died for you ; now I cannot endure
you except when I think you may be of
use to me. I shall send fur you if I
should happen to want you again."

His face grew white, and he set his
teeth. They were in the green drawing-room
of Kilcash House. The full June
sun was flaming abroad on the sea, and
shining in through the windows.

** You outrage me. I am not accustomed
to be "

'" Told the simple truth," she said, finishing
the sentence for him. '' I threatened to ring."

She went to the bell-rope. He sprang
between her and it menacingly.

*'I believe you are capable of violence'
she said, surveying him with a taunting
smile.

I am capable of murder. '^

*only for plunder' she said, still
smiling.

He ground his teeth.

"You will drive me to it, Marion
Butler."

At the mention of her maiden name,
a swift flush of crimson darkened her face.
Her eyes flashed, her nostrils dilated, her
head bent forward, her mouth opened, the
veins in her temple swelled. She clenched
her hands — her bosom heaved — she stood
still.

The sudden change in her appearance
arrested his anger. He believed she was
going to have a fit. Her maiden name

had not been purposely uttered by him.
It loosed some current in the brain which
had not flowed for years.

Awhile she stood thus. 'J'heu all at
once the colour fled from her face, and
left it pallid, cold, rigid. She pressed
her hand once or twice across her brow,
and then, looking at him intently for a
few moments, said, in a quiet, weary
voice :

I am ill. Leave me ; but come tome
soon again. In an hour — half-an-hour.
I did not mean what I said. Pray leave
me, and come to me soon. I shall be
here. I am confused."

Without speaking, and scarcely believing
the words he heard, he stole from the
room.

She sat down on a couch and covered
her face with her hands.

Wait," she said softly to herself.

There is something I must do — something
I have forgotten. Oh, I know ! He
is an honourable gentleman, and must not
be disregarded."

She went over to a table, found writing
materials, sat down, and wrote :

*dear Mr. Paulton,

I got your note this morning. I
told you the first time you did me the
honour of offering me marriage that there
was no hope. I am sorry to say I am
of the same mind still. You will forget
and forgive me in time. I shall never
forget your kindness to me in my distress.
"Yours sincerely,

Marion Butler."

She read the note over and over again
from top to bottom. Something in the

look of it did not please her, but she could
not think of anything better to say. She
had received a note from him that morning,
asking her to grant him another interview.
He had proposed to her a week ago. She
had told him plainly she would not marry
him. He had begged that he might be
allowed to call again. She said it was
quite useless. He craved another interview,
and she gave way, on the understanding
no hope was to be based on
the permission. He had come again, and
again had been refused. And now he was
asking for a third chance. She would
not give it to him. It would be worse
than useless under the circumstances.
There was something wrong with this note,
but it must serve, as Tom Blake was
waiting.

She put the letter in an envelope, addressed
it to Alfred at the 'strand Hotel,"

Kilcash, rang the bell, and sent a servant
off with it.

When it was gone she said :

"I must go now and meet Tom. He

said he'd be Where's this he said

he'd be ? Oh, I know ! By the corner
of the wood on the Brandon Road. Til
put on the white muslin Tom likes. If
Mr. Paulton should come they must say
I am out."

Alfred Paulton got the note, and although
he could not understand the signature —
it was no doubt the result of a lapse of
memory, in which she went back for a
moment to her girlish days — he knew his
dismissal was final.

That day he set off" for London, and
arrived in time to see Madge married to
his old friend, Jerry O'Brien, who was
secretly delighted at the failure of Alfred's
suit.

While Jerry was on his honeymoon he got
a letter from his old friend and solicitor,
the postscript of which gave him the
latest news of Mrs. Davenport : the
doctors had pronounced her hopelessly
insane.

AFTER TEN YEARS.

Jerry O'Brien's words had been no sooner
uttered than he saw how foolishly injudicious
they were. In the excitement
of the moment he had forgotten what
ought to have been uppermost in his
thoughts — the condition of his friend.

He rang the bell. In a few seconds
Madge entered the room. He briefly explained
what had occurred, and then set
off to summon Dr. Santley.

The doctor looked grave, and hurried
back to Carlingford House. Here he
stayed an hour, and left with gloomy

VOL II. B

looks and words. A relapse was possible,
and a great delay to convalescence certain.
There was danger, serious danger of the
patient's life.

Jerry O'Brien was in despair. He had
the greatest affection for Alfred, and he
was in love with Alfred's sister. Yes, he
might as well confess the matter boldly
to himself; plain-looking, gentle, cheerful
Madge was worth more to him than all
the rest of the girls in the world put
together. And here his impetuous rashness
had brought her brother to death's
door. Curses on his rashness !

Santley said he was by no means to
see Alfred again that day, or until he
got formal leave to do so. He would
give no opinion as to the ultimate course
of the disease ; but there was cause for
anxiety — great anxiety.

Jerry took his leave of the house with
a heavy heart. He was quite alone ia

the world, and since lie lost his mother,
now years ago, he had known no trouble
so trying as this. He told himself over
and over again that all would yet be
well with Alfred. In vain ! His heart
would not be comforted; his mind would
not abide in peace.

When he got into town, he did not
know where to turn. The idea of going
to the club under the unpleasant circumstances
was out of the question. Walking
about alone was dull work. He did
not care to call on any friend, and the
notion of spending the evening at a place
of entertainment was simply monstrous.
There seemed to be nothing else for it
but to go home, and that was a stupid
programme enough.

Jerry had lodgings in Cecil Street,
Strand, and thither he went. He let
himself in with a latchkey, and walked
upstairs in the gathering gloom of a

B 2

late February afternoon. His room
were on the second floor. He entered
the one looking out on the street, and
lit the lamp deliberately. There were
two reasons for his proceeding slowly.
In the first place, it was not yet quite
dark ; in the second, deliberation killed
time, and he had nothing to do between
that hour and tomorrow morning, when
he should call to know how Alfred was.

"Killing time," he thought, 'ris, when
one is anxious, an excellent though slow
way of killing one's self."

He pulled down the blinds, drew the
curtains, and roused up the smouldering
fire; then, with a heavy sigh, he threw
himself into an easy chair, and looked
indolently, discontentedly around.

The room at best was not very cheering
or elegant. The house was old, the
room low, the furniture heavy, by no
means fresh, and far from new. The

table on which the lamp stood had a
staring crimson cover. This was a recent
and outrageous addition to the chromatic
elements of the place. Until that afternoon
the cover had been of a dim, nameless
green, quite inoffensive, except for
motley stains.

In his present state of mind, this cover
felt like an insult, and he rose quickly,
and, having lifted the lamp, flung the
obnoxious cover into a corner, and was
about to sit down again, when his eyes
caught sight of a letter lying on the
carpet at his feet.

He stooped and picked it up.

"A letter from O'Hanlon, and a fat
letter, too ! What can it be, now ?
Nothing more about those weirs and the
commissioners, I hope. Well, even the
weirs and the commissioners in moderation
would be better than dwelling on this
wretched business about poor Alfred."

He broke the cover, sat down, and began
to read a long and closely written letter
in a clerks hand. It was signed in a
different hand 'john O'Hanlon," and from
a printed chaplet in the corner it appeared
John O'Hanlon was a solicitor residing at
Kilbarry.

Jerry O'Brien read on resolutely. The
only sign he gave of perturbation while
mastering the eight pages he held in his
hand was now and then crossing, uncrossing,
and recrossing his legs. When
he came to the end he threw the letter
from him with an exclamation of annoyance
and disgust. Then he sat awhile
motionless, with his elbow resting on the
table, his cheek on his hand, and his eyebrows
drawn low down over his eyes. At
last he muttered :

"It is my unfortunate weirs again — or
rather, it is the weirs of unfortunate me.

They'll end by tearing up my weirs and
leaving me to graze on the parish. I'll
make a nice pauper — splendid ! I don't
think paupers have numbers like convicts ;
but if they have, I shall be number
naught, naught, naught recurring. Confound
those commissioners eternally ! Obstruct
the navigation of the Bawn ! My
salmon weirs obstruct as much the navigation
of the Bawn as they do of the
Euphrates or the Mississippi ! If I had
my will, these infernal, meddling commissioners
would be drowned first in the
Euphrates and then in the Mississippi,
after which I'd give them a roasting alive
in Vesuvius for a change. This will take
eight hundred a year out of my pocket,
and hand it over to — the Atlantic, and
parts adjacent ! That's a nice way to help
a struggling country ! "

He paused for a while, and began

walking up and down the room hastily,
angrily. Presently his thoughts took
another turn.

"It's fortunate I said nothing to Madge.
She must know by this time how I feel
towards her, and I don't think her people
would have any objection if this infernal
affair was not hanging over me. But I
could not speak to her father if I had
to say : * Will you, sir, be good enough
to bring your daughter over to Kilbarry,
and see her married to me in the poorhouse
? ' It would not look swell. Not a
bit of it ! Why, 'twould look quite squalid
and ungenteel. Never mind, Madge. I'll
fight them, darling, to the last. I won't
leave a stone unturned, and every one I
turn I'll fling at these rapacious fools."

He paused in his walk at the table.

He took up the letter again and looked
at the end of it.

He says I must go over at once —

that I must start to-night. That's peremptory
and but short notice. Never mind ;
it may be all for the best. I know the
people at Dulwich will not think I am
running away from them after bringing
this fresh trouble upon them. They are
the most generous people in the world.
My honour is perfectly safe with them.
I have plenty of time to catch the mail.
This letter must have come at noon, and
fallen off the table. I'll write a letter
to Carlingford House explaining matters,
and then when I have packed a portmanteau
I shall be all right for the road."
He sang in a low voice:

** With my pistols cocked, and a kind good-night,
Then hurrah, hurrah for the road ! "

Adding: **I wish to heavens the days
were not gone for 'pistols cocked' and
'* the road.' Nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to bag these accursed commissioners

on the road, or in the water
or on the wing. Unfortunately, ' old times
aro changed, old manners gone as the
poet says, and shooting even ruffianly
commissioners is against the law of the
laud, or the sea, or the air."

He got writing materials, gave Mr.
Paulton a short account of the reason for
his unexpected departure from London ;.
then he ordered his dinner, packed his
portmanteau, ate his dinner, and caught
the mail train for Holyhead easily.

He slept half the way from Euston to
Holyhead, and nearly all the way from
Holyhead to Kingstown. In Dublin, at
an hotel close to the Westland Row Station,
he got his breakfast, and then drove to
Kingsbridge, where he booked and took
train for Kilbarry, an important town in
the south of Ireland.

A railway journey in the early part of
the year from Dublin to the south of

Ireland is far from exhilarating. Half
the way may be performed at a fair, but
the second half is done at a funereal pace.
The country looks damp, and is ill-clad
with trees. It has not yet donned its
summer vesture of astonishing green.
The towns are small, far apart, and
generally invisible from the train. Few
people are on the platforms, and the
stations of even important towns are paltry
and forlorn. There are occasionally lovely
mountains and pastoral streams, but the
whole effect is dulling, depressing, from the
absence of trees and the melancholy thinness
of the population. It is a country
empty of its children, and desolate at the
loss of them.

Jerry O'Brien was of a mercurial nature,
and when he was down he was at zero,
and when up, at boiling. This last stage
of his journey plunged him into the profoundest
gloom. Overhead there was a.

sick, watery sun, which gave a feeble
white glare more detecting than a pall of
thunder cloud. Tobacco was powerless to
ameliorate the chill influence of that
changing landscape. He tried to read a
newspaper, but found he could not fix his
attention on one word of what he read.
After ascertaining; there was nothing in it
about Fishery Commissioners, he gave it
up as a bad job, and laid it with resignation
on the rug which covered his knees.

When he arrived at Kilbarry he was in
the lowest and most desponding state of
mind. He was firmly persuaded that
nothing could save his weirs, and was
almost convinced that the first news he
should hear was that his weirs had been
destroyed, and that the commissioners had
resolved to lynch him if they could lay
hands on him before he died of hunger.

He left the station in an omnibus and
drove along the mile of broad quays beside

the noble river Bawn to the " Minster
Hotel." Here the prospect was more cheering
than on the bleak, cold journey down.
The river was thick with shipping; the
quays noisy with traffic ; the stores, warehouses,
wharfs, and shops alive with people.
Sailing vessels were discharging corn and
coal, and steamers taking in cattle, and
cases of eggs, and bales of bacon, and
firkins of butter. Here the stream of
humanity was vivid and strong. Moderate
prosperity asserted its presence blithely.
The weather had cleared and brightened,,
and the sun hung in the clear western
air, a pale golden shield of light.

O'Brien was well known at "The Munster*'
and as he went up the steps of the hotel,
was greeted cordially by the cheerful landlord
and a few loungers with whom he was.
acquainted. He did not see a trace of the
hated Fishery Commissioners, and by the
time he had eaten a light luncheon, he

began to think they were little more than
an amiable fiction of a jovial Government.
No one he met seemed to think his fortunes
were in peril. The manners of John, the
old waiter, were respectful and joyous as
though the traveller had just returned
from far distant lands, after an absence
of many years, to enter into possession of
a princely patrimony.

There was no time to be lost if he
wanted to catch his solicitor, O'Hanlon,
at the office. Accordingly he set off at
once in that direction, and, having gone
through two or three streets, found himself
in the presence of his legal adviser, agent,
and friend all in one.

John O'Hanlon was a man past middle
life, tall, a little stooped in the shoulders,
black-haired, neither fat nor lean, dark,
ruddy, with whiskers just tinged with gray,
loud-voiced, and aggressive in manner, and
owning a pair of enormous brown hands.

One of the peculiarities of O^Hanlon was
that no matter how well prepared he might
be for the advent of any one who came
to him he was always at that moment busy,
or about to be busy, with something or
somebody else.

As the young man entered the private
office of the solicitor the latter rose
hastily, pointed to a chair, and said
rapidly :

*'A minute, O'Brien — a minute. Sit
down. I want to tell Gorman something."


Gorman was the head clerk — a repaired,
restless little man, who was always
to be found in the front office, and who
never seemed to have anything more important
to do than lean against the folded
window-shutter and look out into the street,
but who was reputed to be more wily
than any two fully sworn-in attorneys in
Kilbarry.

After a short absence, O'Haiilon came
back.

My dear O'Brien, I'm delighted to see
you."

He took both his client's hands, and
shook them most cordially. He had the
reputation of being the most insincere man
you could meet on a summer's day ; but
no one had ever been able to point
out any one act of insincerity in his
conduct.

I got your letter," said O'Brien, after
replying to the greetings of the other, " and
here I am. I came post-haste."

Eight, right, my boy ! Those rascally
commissioners will be the death of me.
They'll be the death of every man in the
neighbourhood who takes an interest in
salmon, except the net men."

Well, what is it this time ? The same
old story, as well as I could gather from
your letter."

'the same old story over aofain. The
same old three-and-fourpence — (a professional
sum, which, I am sorry to see,
has grown into a saying, although a colourless
and unmeaning saying). The facts
are these."

Here the solicitor crave a long and energetic
account of the vile proceedings of
these rascally commissioners, and wound
up by saying that they hadn't a leg to
stand on, and that " we " were sure to
win in the long run, but that to insure
success it was absolutely necessary for
O'Brien to be in town or within very easy
call for a month or two, as petitions and
declarations and so-ons had to be considered,
drawn up, and attended to generally
and particularly.

When Jerry heard the whole state of
affairs, he felt considerably relieved on
the score of his salmon weirs on the lower
Bawn. Upon telling this to his friend,

VOL. II. C

the latter became hilarious, slapped Jerry
on the back, and said that he'd prove the
commissioners were the greatest fools in
Ireland, and, moreover, make them confess
it themselves in their own little dirty
hole-and-corner court.

These and other gallant words and
brave assurances served to put Jerry
in good spirits, and when he rose to
leave he was as buoyant as though he
already held the proofs of triumph in his
hand.

As he was about to quit the office,
O'Hanlon took him by the hand, and
mysteriously said :

You were in London while that Davenport
inquest was going on ? "

'eyes."

Do you know anything about it ? "

O'Brien's good spirits instantly took
flight.

Too much I I know everything about

it."

"You read a good report of the inquest
?'*

*• No ; I was at the inquest."

** Ah-h ! " It was a long-drawn, deep
breath. The eyes of the solicitor became
suddenly introspective, and he lolled his
head over his right shoulder as if in
deep thought. "Why did you attend
that inquest ? "

"Well, for two reasons. First, I, as
you of course know, was acquainted with
the Davenports ; and second, because the
dearest friend I have in London was greatly
interested in Mrs. Davenport. It's a long
story."

Is it ? Ah-h ! I am greatly interested
in that story too."

Are you ? Why ? I didn't think you

knew the Davenports."

c 2

The solicitor straightened his head on
his shoulders. His eyes were still turned
inward.

You are right so far. I did not know
the Davenports. But do you remember a
client of mine named Michael Fahey —
commonly called Mike Fahey ! "

Let me see. That's a good while
ago ? "

Ten or eleven years ago," said the
solicitor, shaking his head in accord with
his private thoughts rather than with his
words.

"I do. He was drowned near Kilcash,
wasn't he ? "

"At the Black Rock."
An awful death. I never think of
any one being drowned there without
shuddering. Wasn't there something
wrong with that man — that client of
yours J

Yes. The police were after him."

Why do you speak of him now ? "

"Don't you remember that when seen
by the police who were in chase he was
in the neighbourhood of Davenport's house,
and that he ran like a madman until he
got to the Black Rock, and then threw
himself in ? "

Yes ; it makes my flesh creep," said
O'Brien, with a shiver.

He left some documents in my possession.
They are in my possession yet.
They show he had some connection with
Davenport. I had forgotten all about it
until "

The solicitor paused, and suddenly the
eyes, which had been so long turned
inward, flashed out their light, and blazed
into those of the young man standing
opposite.

O'Brien started back in vague dread.

** Until when ? " he asked, in a low,
constrained voice.

Until this day week."
"And then "— Ollaulon's eyes dilated
—<^l saw "

In the name of Heaven, what ? "
'this ghost."

SEEING NOT BELIEVING.

PoR a moment the young man looked
at the other in amazement and doubt.
But it was impossible to resist for any
great length of time the conviction that
O'Hanlon had spoken sincerely. O'Hanlon
himself looked troubled, scared, affrighted,
as though scarcely able, and wholly unwilling,
to believe his own words. O'Brien
was the first to recover his composure.

** I will not," he said, " question what
you say ; I will go so far as to assure
you I am fully convinced you saw the
ghost of that unhappy man. You want

me to tell 3-011 a story which, as 1
said, is a long one, ami I want you to
tell me your story at length. Dine with
me at ' The Munster ' this evening at
seven, and we can chat the matter over."

The reference to the hotel and dinner
drew the mind of the lawyer back once
more into its ordinary groove. With a
shrug of his shoulders and a forced laugh
he said :

Eighth — you are right, O'Brien. This
is not a good time or place for our little
private theatricals. Ill join you with
pleasure at seven. Here I have been
holding you, which is an assault, and
detaining you against your will, which
is false imprisonment — both punishable bylaw.
I ought to be too old a stager to
be guilty of either offence. But I cry
mercy, and will do my best to wash
away my offences in your claret this
evening. Till then, adieu."

So they parted.

O'Brien resolved to stroll about until
it was time for dinner He knew every
street, almost every house in Kilbarry.
He had lived in the neighbourhood the
most part of his life. He had no relative
alive, nor any place he could call home.
When in this neighbourhood he usually
stopped at *' The Munster " ; but of late
years he had spent much of his time in
London. He owned the land close to
which his salmon weirs stood on the
Bawn ; but there was no house for hit
on them — only a few rude, primitive
farmers' houses.

He was now thirty years of age, and
had been a rover most of his life. He
had always made it a point to spend a
month or two of the summer at Kilcash,
a sea-bathing and fishing village ten miles
by road from Kilbarry. Here it was that
he learned what he knew of the Davenports,

for Mr. Davenport's place, Kilcash
House, was only a mile inland from the
village whose name it bore. He had been
personally acquainted with the Davenports,
and had often seen them, and knew all
about them.

O'Hanlon's words, now that he was from
under the influence of the manner which
-accompanied them, filled him with wonder
more than anything else. He was only
nineteen or twenty at the time that man
Fahey was drowned — or, rather, committed
suicide — and he could not recall all the
particulars of the case. When it occurred,
he had been living with his widowed
mother at Kilbarry, and had not, like
other young men of the city, gone out
to the scene of the tragedy. He knew
every nook of the coast for miles around
Kilcash. It was a bold, bad, rock-bound
coast save at the village, where there was
-a bay and a strand fatal to ships. He

Remembered that, from the first news of
Fahey's death, there had not been the least
hope of recovering the man's body. It was
a tradition of the coast that the body of no
one who had been drowned there was
ever recovered. Who or what Fahey was
he did not know, and so he resolved to
banish the subject from his mind until
O'Hanlon reopened it that evening.

The great feature of this day was
O'Hanlon's assurance that his weirs would
not be torn up. If that were true, and
Alfred Paulton recovered, then he would
have to think of building a house somewhere
near the weirs for — Madge.

He got back to the hotel a little before
seven, and wrote a letter to Mr. Paulton,
announcing his safe arrival, asking for news
of Alfred, and sending his kindest regards
to the others in the order of their seniority.
It was a little comfort to be able to send
even kind regards to Madge through her

father. But if he had the commissioners
by the collective throat at that moment,
he could have throttled them with great
comfort to himself, and an assured consciousness
that he was a benefactor to
mankind.

Seven o'clock brought O'Hanlon and the
dinner. The latter was served in a small,
snug, private room overlooking the broad
white river. When at length they were
alone and had lighted their cigars, the
guest reverted to the Davenport affair,
and asked for the full and true history
of the case as far as it was known to
Jerry.

Then O'Hanlon's turn came :

Since I saw you I have hunted up
and glanced over the documents left in
my hands by the dead man Fahey. They
are, I find, unintelligible, as far as my
lights now lead me, and I think we may
dismiss them from our minds for the present.

I shall, however, keep them safe.
I will say nothing more of them than that
in whatever portions of them Mr. Davenport
is mentioned, they always speak of
him in terms of gratitude and respect. It
is plain that at one time the relations between
these two men were very close, but
of the nature of these relations there is
no hint. At the time of the death of
Fahey he had been hovering about Kil-cash
for months. No one exactly knew
who or what he was. He had taken a
mean lodging in the village, and given
out that he was poor, and had been ordered
to the seaside for his health, and recommended
to get as much sea air and boating
as possible. He often went out with the
fishermen, and at last bought a small punta
mere cockleshell, and kept it for his own
exclusive use. In this he put off at all
times of the day and night, and the fishermen
predicted that he would be drowned

some time or other ; and so he was, but
not in the way anticipated by the people
of the visage. They made sure his boat
would be swamped one day, and that would
be the end of him. An additional reason
for their fears was that he never swam, and
said he was too old to learn.

On the day of his death he was
followed from a distance by two policemen
in plain clothes. They watched him leave
the cottage in which he lived at Kilcash,
take to the downs, and make straight for
Kilcash House. They were not able to
get near him until he had just gained the
house. He then became aware that he
was followed, and ran straight for the
cliffs. The rest I have already told you.
There never was an inquest, for, as you
may know, the bodies of people drowned
there are never found.

A week ago I was in the neighbourhood
of Kilcash House. I had left my horse

and car at Kilcash, and was walking over
the downs to the village, when on the-cliffs,
just over the Black Rock, I cast my
eyes down, and there, on that large shelf
of rock, as plain as I see you now, I saw
him. The same coat, the same Scotch
bonnet, the same trousers — not a thing
altered since the first day he stood in my
office, going on eleven years ago."

'* What time of the day was it ? "

Broad day. About three o'clock in the
afternoon."

It must have been some one of about,
his stature dressed identically."

'must it ?" cried the lawyer, scornfully.
** You have not heard all yet. I made up
my mind to be sure. I ran — I ran to
the top of the path, and went down to
the rocks below. There was nobody there.
You know the place. Tell me how a living
man could get away alive, except up the
path that I went down ? It was Michael

Fahey*s ghost, as sure as I am a living

man."

I confess," said Jerry, in perplexity,
*' I cannot explain away what you say,
except upon the supposition that you were
suffering from delusion. How do you
account for the appearance yourself ? "

This is my way of reasoning it out.
I either saw the ghost of Michael Fahey
or I did not. If I did, I account for it
by the fact that Davenport and he were
associated together in something while
they were alive, and now that both are
dead, one of them has to come back and
see that something left undone — a wrongs
frighted, a debt unpaid, an explanation
unmade — is put straight."

But why should the one be Fahey ?
And why should it be at the Black Rock ?
And why should he appear to you ? "

"The first, because I had nothing to do
with Mr. Davenport; the second, because

seeing Fahey's ghost there would recall
to my mind most vividly the circumstance
of his death ; and the third, because
I hold the documents to which I
have referred."

But don't you think the fact of
Davenport's name having been brought
before the public so lately, and that you
recollected the documents you held belonging
to Fahey, and that you looked
over the cliff at the very spot where he
lost his life, may all have helped to impose
upon your imagination ? "

** Sir, an attorney of my years does not
know the meaning of the word imagination.
You may say I am mad if you like, but
don't attribute imagination to me, or I
shall break down altogether. O'Brien, do
you mean to say seriously that you take
me for a crazy young poet ? Great
heavens, sir, it can't have come to that
with me in my declining years ! "

VOL. II. D

But, then, what did you see ? "

''A ghost— Fahey's ghost."

You don't mean to tell me seriously
you believe in ghosts I "

''I mean to tell you most emphatically
I do not."

** Then what is your contention ? "

That I, being one who does not believe
in ghosts, saw the ghost of Michael
Fahey this day week at the Black
Rock."

'' I can make nothing of your position."

*' I can make nothing of my position
either. I am beginning to think I shall
lose my reason. You are the first person
I spoke to on the subject. Don't say
anything about it to a soul. I have no
wife to blab to, and I look on you as a
friend. I had hoped you would have
brought me news from London — some facts
not published in the papers, and bearing

on this branch of the case. But you
haven't. If you let this get abroad, some
of my kind friends will get me locked up.
I got old Coolahan locked up because he
kept on saying that farthings were as
valuable as sovereigns because they had the
Queen's head on them."

O'Brien was sorely puzzled. It did not
now look like a matter which ought to be
laughed at. Either O'Hanlon had seen
the ghost of this man, or he was losing
his reason. There was one other possibility.
He said : ** I am not going to make light
of what you have told me, or communicate
it to a soul. There is one other question
a wild one, I own. I wonder have
you thought of it ? "

What is it ? If you have thought of
anything which has escaped me, you are a
very Daniel come to judgment."

Could it be that man was not really

D 2

drowned ten or eleven years ago ? Either
the police may have been mistaken in
their man, and the wrong man may
have leaped into the hole, or Fahey may
have leaped in and by some miracle
escaped."

*eyes, I have thought of both possibilities.
The only answer will dispose of
both. The clothes seen ten or eleven,
years ago, and those seen this day week,
were identical."

What ! You identify them ? "
'eyes, if" — with a shudder — "those of
last week could be produced and handled.
O'Brien, I'm not afraid of ghosts, but I
begin to be afraid of myself, now that I
have begun to see them."

'' But after such a lapse of time, and at a
long distance, as from the top of the cliff to
the plain of rock below. It must be a
hundred feet."

It is a hundred and twenty feet from the
brow of the cliff to where the cliff meets the
sloping rock, and the figure was about one
hundred and seventy or eighty feet from
the base. I measured both roughly. That
gives between seventy and eighty yards
from my eye. Now, ten years ago, and
this day week, the colour, cut, and material
of the coat and trousers were identical, and
both times there was a circular green patch
on the right elbow of the coat, about the
size of my palm ; and both times the right
leg of the trousers had evidently been torn
up as high as the knee-joint behind, and
rudely stitched by an unskilful hand. I'm
not," he said, looking timidly around,
afraid of ghosts, but I am of men.
Keep my secret, O'Brien, if you care forme."


You may swear by me. By - the -
way, I have more time than you. Let

me see those documents you have, and
rU try if I can puzzle anything out of
them."

With the greatest pleasure and thankfulness."


And so the two parted.

TOLD BY German.

The documents Jerry O'Brien found in his
hand were four in number. He read them
all hastily first, and then went over them
carefully word by word. When he examined
them next day, they proved insubstance
or text to be as follows :

No. 1. A will dated about eleven years
back, by which he left all property of any
kind of which he might die possessed to
Mrs. Davenport, wife of his good friend
Louis Davenport. He explained that he
would have left his property to Mr.
Davenport himself, but that so well did

he know the depth of affection between
Mr. Davenport and his wife, that the surest
way to make a bequest acceptable to the
former, was to leave it to the latter. The
bequest was accompanied by no conditions,
and the will wound up with a hope that
Mr. and Mrs. Davenport might live long
and happy lives.

To the will was affixed a piece of paper,
on which appeared in the handwriting of
O'Hanlon, the solicitor, this comment :

Note. — There being no trace of property
or relatives of deceased, nothing
could be done. I sent my clerk to Mr.
Davenport to make some inquiries, but
could learn nothing except that deceased
was an eccentric friend of Mr.
Davenport, and that as far as he
(Davenport) knew, deceased had neither
relatives nor property.

This was signed '' John O'Hanlon.''

No. II. This was half a sheet of notepaper
partly covered by writing not
nearly so regular or well-formed as the
will. To judge by the handwriting of
No. III., it was the manuscript of Michael
Fahey. It ran thus :

Memorandum. — Rise 15-6 lowest. At
lowest minute of lowest forward with all
might undaunted. The foregoing refers
to skulls. With only one skull any lowest
or any last quarter ; but great forward
pluck required for this. In both cases
(of course !) left.

No. III. was a letter of instructions
from Fahey to O'Hanlon in the handwriting
of Fahey. It was as follows :

Dear Sir,

I leave with you my will and
three other papers. In case of anything

happening to me, please read the will
and put it in force, But if between this
and then you hear nothing more from
me, it will not be worth while taking
any trouble in the matter. The * Memorandum
' is to be kept by you for me.
In case I should absent myself from the
neighbourhood for any length of time do
not be uneasy, as I am much abroad. If
I am away fifteen ' years, you may hand
all these to my friend, Mr. Davenport,,
but not till fifteen years have passed
without my return to the neighbourhood.
Yours truly,

"Michael Fahey."

No. IV. was merely a long, narrow, slip
of paper, bearing the following :

Dear Mr. Davenport,

Time has swallowed me, and
everything connected with me. I hope

when you receive this you will have
forgotten I ever existed. I leave all the
documents I own with Mr. O'Hanlon for
you.

Always most faithfully yours,

Michael Fahey."

These did not throw a great flood of
light on the subject. In fact, they did
not help him to see an inch further than
he had seen before. It was plain on the
face of it that there must have been some
kind of connection between this Fahey and
the Davenports ; but what the nature of
that connection was there was no clue
to. He had no particular interest in the
mystery, if it could be said to reach
the dignity of a mystery. He was a kind
of indifferent centre in the events. He
had known the Davenports and O'Hanlon
for years, and now by a strange coincidence,
or rather a series of coincidences

the Davenports, O'Hanlon, the Paultons,
Fahey, and himself had all been drawn
together.

He shook himself and tried to argue
himself into indifference, but failed. He
told himself the whole matter was nothing
in the world to him, and that, in fact,
there was nothing particular in it to
engage attention.

What were the facts ?

Mr. Davenport had, under acute mental
excitement, committed suicide after an
interview with Tom Blake. He had left
two documents respecting that act. Both
of these documents were written in pencil,
and on leaves of his pocket-book. One
of these memoranda said he, Davenport,
had committed suicide. The other accused
Blake of poisoning, murdering him. Everyone
except Edward Davenport credited
the former statement. Blake had formerly
been Mrs. Davenport's lover, and might

love her even still. Blake had got a
thousand pounds years ago from the
deceased for giving up his pretensions
to that lady's hand. Blake had long
been abroad ; turned up unexpectedly at
Davenport's house in London the first
night the latter was in London, and the
night of his death. Blake gets a hundred
pounds from Davenport, and a promise
of a further hundred in a few days.

What was this money given for ? Not,
of course, with the old object. It did not
come out at the inquest or elsewhere that
the dead man had been in the least jealous
of his wife. She had not seen Blake fora
good while before her husband's death.
Blake had been some years on the Continent,
without visiting the United Kingdom. It
was discreditable, but intelligible, that when
the dead man was an elderly and unfavoured
lover he should buy off his rival ;
but it would be absurd to suppose that

ten or eleven years after marriage any
man would continue to pay considerable
sums of money to a former rival for absolutely
nothing. Such an act would be
that of a coward and a fool, and the deadman
had been neither.

For what, then, had Davenport given
this money to Blake ? The latter said the
interview between the two had been of a
pleasant character. Why ? Blake was disreputable,
and Davenport eminently respectable.
It was absurd to suppose Davenport
could have had a liking for Blake. Taking
that thousand pounds years ago must have
destroyed any good opinion Davenport had
of Blake. Why, then, had the latter been
received well and been given money ? He
had not only been received well and given
money, but invited to dinner on a later
date ! It was simply incredible that out
of gratitude for that service rendered long
ago in Florence, Davenport was going to

forget that this man had been his rival,
and invite him to his house and a necessary
meeting with his beautiful wife.

O'Brien did not for a moment suspect
the widow and her former admirer of
perjury, of concocting their stories. These
stories were not at all calculated to exculpate
either of the two. In fact, these
stories, uncorroborated by the evidence
obtained at the post-mortem examination,
would have heightened suspicion rather
than allayed it. At first these stories
seemed prodigal in daring, but this very
excess of apparent improbability made them
seem most probable when read by the light
of Davenport's written confession. No,
there was no reason to suspect perjury.

He could make nothing of it so far.
But did those documents of Fahey's aid
one towards a solution ? He could not
see how they bore on the case one way
or the other, and yet the coincidences were

remarkable. He had seen Blake in London
the day of the night on which Davenport
died. Ashen Alfred Paulton told him what
had happened at Crescent House, he came
to the conclusion Blake was in some way
or other mixed up in the matter. This
conclusion turned out right, although not
exactly in the way he had expected. Now
upon his coming back to Kilbarry he is
met by a still more remarkable story. A
man whom O'Hanlon knew ten or eleven
years ago, and was then drowned at the
hideous Black Rock, appears to O'Hanlon in
the same spot and same clothes as he had
been last seen alive in. It seemed as if he,
O'Brien, were destined to be connected with
the Davenport affair whether he would or
not. Alfred Paulton was the greatest friend
he had in London, and John O'Hanlon
was the best friend he had in Kilbarry.
He knew Blake by appearance and report,
and he was acquainted with the Davenports;

and here were all mixed up in the same
matter in more or less degree, and all ina
disagreeable way. It was the smallest
of small worlds. He had no particular
reason for being interested in the complication
; and, indeed, except for the extraordinary
statement made by O'Hanlon, the
incident might be said to be closed, were
it not that he was not quite sure whether
Alfred Paulton — whom he hoped one day
to have for a brother-in-law — had got over
the fascination exercised on him by that
beautiful woman. Any way, he had nothing
particular to do now but fight those
rascally commissioners ; so he'd just glance
over these documents again, and see if he
could make anything out of them.

With a sigh, he put them away a second
time. He might as well look for help
to the stars. He would call at O'Hanlon's
to-day and ask was there any news.

He found Mr. Gorman, head clerk to

VOL. II. B

O'Hanlon, leaning against his favourite
shutter with his hands in his trousers*
pockets, placidly regarding through the
window a tattered, battered, and wholly
miserable-looking man of between sixty
and seventy, who was playing *' The Young
May Moon," atrociously out of tune and
out of time, on a penny tin whistle.

*swell," said O'Brien, briskly to Gorman,.
any news ? "

"Not a blessed word," answered the
clerk, resting his back against the shutter
instead of his shoulder, and so facing
the visitor. " I suppose you came over
about your weirs ? Deuced bother, Mr.
O'Brien!"

*''It is an infernal nuisance. Do you
know, Mr. Gorman, I think half the people
who ought to be hanged are never even
brought to trial."

"These Fishery Commissioners don't
murder any one but fisheries and the

proprietors of fisheries, and there is no
precedent for hanging a man merely because
he killed a fishery or the proprietor of a
fishery. However, Mr. O'Brien, you need
not be afraid. Your weirs are as safe as
the Rock of Castel. I often wonder why
they call a rock a rock. It's about the
last thing that would think of rocking,
and the sea, which is the best rocker out,
can't stir a rock that's in good wind
and form. It would take the Atlantica
month of Sundays to rock the Black
Rock, for instance, at Kilcash."

The mention of the Black Rock made
O'Brien start slightly, for it was in the
rock that famous and treacherous Hole
yawned and breathed dismay and destruction.
It was odd Gorman should mention
the rock which had occupied such
a prominent place in his thoughts that
forenoon.

*rit's strange," said O'Brien, walking

over to the window, and placing himself
against the shutter opposite Gorman, " that
I should have been thinking of the Black
Kock a little while ago ! What put it
into your head now ? "

*' Well, I tell you, nothing could be
simpler or more natural. I knew you
arrived from London yesterday. I knew
you were acquainted with the Davenports
of Kilcash, and a man who once had some
connection with the Davenports was last
seen on the Black Rock, and drowned
himself, to escape the police, in the Hole
You may remember the circumstance ? "

Yes," said O'Brien, instantly interested ;
"I have a faint recollection of that man's
death. Were you with Mr. O'Hanlon
then ? "

*'0h, yes. I remember all about it.
He was a client of ours. We didn't do
much for him; in fact, we didn't do an

thing for him. He left some papers with
the governor, and then got into trouble
about passing flash notes. The police had
their hands just on him, when he leapt
into the Hole. You know what that
means. The body was never found ; but
that does not count as anything, for the
bodies of persons drowned near that spot
are never found."

"And nothing was known of the connection
between this unfortunate Fahey
and the Davenports ? "

I don't know anything about it, and
I don't think the governor does. It was
supposed he was an old hanger-on of old
Davenport's, since the time Davenport
was abroad. Davenport himself, as far
as I could find out, never volunteered
information about Fahey ; and, you know,
he wasn't the kind of man you'd care to
ask unnecessary questions. He was about

the closest man in the county. I never
had any business to do with him, but
I've kept my ears open."

He died very rich, I suppose ? " —
with a laugh. *'A friend of mine is
already greatly interested in the widow."

Ah, no wonder ! She's a fine woman —
the finest woman in these parts. I often saw
her. You might do worse than try your
luck there yourself, Mr. O'Brien. If he
left her the bulk of his fortune she will
be very well ofi". He had no one else
in the world but his brother, who is
crack-brained, I believe ; and the deadman
was very rich — made a whole fortune
abroad, in various kinds of speculations,
both in Europe and America."

What did he speculate in chiefly ? "

I don't know. All kinds of stocks and
shares. They say he had some plan never
before adopted, and out of which he made
money as fast as he liked, and this plan he

never would tell any one. At all events,
for more than ten years before he settled
sown here he had been wandering pretty
well over the whole civilized world. Every
sone who knew of his great business cleverness
wondered why he retired before fifty,
but he said he had enough for a lifetime,
and that his asthma was too bad for him
to go on any longer. But somehow it
leaked out that he got a great fright
about some bank on the Continent in
which he had a large sum of money — I
think ten thousand pounds — lodged to
his credit."

Do you remember the story, Gorman ? "

I do."

"Well, tell it to me. But, for heaven's
sake, first send out the boy and order
that man with the tin whistle to go
away. Here's sixpence for him."

"Not fond of music! I thought you
were." He took the coin, and despatched

the boy. "The Bank of England had
its own reasons for keeping the thing
quiet at the time, and it never ^ came
fully before the public, as the criminal
was never discovered. Mr. Davenport
gave notice to the foreign bank that on
a certain day he would require the ten
thousand he had lodged there, and that
the more Bank of England notes he
found in the packet, the better he should
be pleased.

^' On the day he had named he called
and got the money, and that very
evening started for London with the
cash. This was an unusual mode of
proceeding, but most of his ways were
unusual, if not odd. On his arrival the
Bank declared several of the one hundred
pound notes in his packet to be forgeries,
and a few tens were also spurious.

This discovery started an inquiry,
and in a little while it was found that

one of the largest and most skilful
forgeries ever made on the Bank of
England had just been committed, and
that upwards of two hundred thousand
pounds worth of valueless notes had been
palmed off on foreign banks of the highest
class.

The forgeries did not stop at the
notes. The signatures of some of the
greatest banking firms had been imitated
and used as introductions to the Continental
houses of eminence, and an elaborate
scheme of fraud had been based on
these bogus introductions. The scheme had
been in preparation for a long time. At
first a small private account was opened
in the regular way in London, the
referees — two customers of the bank —
being a retired military man and a shopkeeper,
I think. I forget what name the
account was opened in — false one, of
course, say Jenkins.

Jenkins's account was gradually augmented,
and a balance of a couple or
three thousand was always kept. Moneys
were now and then paid in and drawn
out. The account was highly respectable.
In the end Jenkins said he was
going to live in Paris, and would feel
obliged if his banker would give him an
introduction to a Paris house. This was
done as a matter of course.

"In Paris the balance was still further
increased, until it was kept above eve
thousand pounds. Then Jenkins asked
if he might deposit a box containing
valuable documents for safety in the
bank. He got permission and lodged the
box.

"Then he drew out all his balance very
gradually, and when it was exhausted,
called, asked for his box, opened it in
the presence of the manager, and taking
from it fifty Bank of England one hundred

pound notes, asked that they might be
placed to his credit, as he was expecting
heavy calls momently. He had been
speculating and had lost, he said. Ina
couple of weeks he drew out the
^VQ thousand in one cheque payable to
himself.

*' Shortly after this he took from the box,
:ind handed the manager ten thousand
pounds, saying he was still losing heavily,
hind should want the money that day,
subject, of course, to a fair charge on the
part of the bank. The bank accommodated
him. He said there was a great deal more
than ten ten thousands in the box, and
;showed the notes to the manager. Next
Hay he came in a great state of excitement.
He had a vast fortune within his grasp
if he could only get money that day.
He took from his pocket one hundred
thousand pounds in Bank of England
notes, and from his box all that was in

it — one hundred and ten thousand more.
Would they oblige him ? It was neck
or nothing with him. If he hadn't the
money within three hours, he would bea
ruined man ; if he got the money, he
could make a stupendous fortune. He
would leave the odd ten thousand in
the hands of the bank against expenses,
interest, etc. Would they let him have
two hundred thousand in French notes on
the security of the Bank of England notes ?
"After an hour's consideration the bank
gave him the money, and never saw
Mr. Jenkins afterwards. The two hundred
and ten thousand pounds were forged notes.
He had of course a capital of ten thousand
pounds in good notes, but these he
carried off. What he did at the box was
mostly sleight-offhand, for he was supposed
to have brought the good notes in his
pocket, and by a little elementary legerdemain

appeared to take them out of the
box which contained the forged notes.

"Mr. Davenport was in Paris at the
time, and by the merest chance drew
out all his money next day, when he
got some of the forged notes, and on
bringing them to London the crime was
discovered.

At first people were much concerned
for Mr. Davenport, but they afterwards
heard he would get all his money from the
French bank. It appears Mr. Davenport
gave two forged ten-pound notes — all the
notes were tens and hundreds — to the
unfortunate Fahey ; and although he passed
them in Dublin, he got as far as Kilcash
before the police came up with him. The
silliest part of it all was that he should
be such a fool as to drown himself ;
for after he threw himself into the
Hole, Mr. Davenport recollected he had

given him the notes, and said Fahey's
had come out of what the French bank
had handed him.

The whole affair gave Mr. Davenport
an ugly turn, and they say he retired
from business earlier than he had intended,
even bad as his asthma undoubtedly was.
That's all I know of the story," said
Gorman, as he turned once more with
his shoulder to the shutter, and gazed
out into the dull, damp street.

THE SEA.

After a few more words of no interest
with Gorman, Jerry O'Brien went into
the private office of O'Hanlon, and found
that gentleman encircled by hedges of
legal documents, fast asleep, with a newspaper
before him. The opening of the
door roused the solicitor, who straightway
sprang to his feet, exclaiming:

'* My dear O'Brien, delighted to see you I
Sit down. I'll be back in a moment."

He left the room, hastened into the
outer office, asked Gorman what o'clock
it was, and if the mail had been delivered

yet, and then hurried back to his client,
saying :

** Excuse my running away ; there was
something I had to say to my clerk. Now,
how are you ? What kind of a night
had you ? "

I'm quite well, and had an excellent
night. And you ? "

Oh, bad, bad ! Nothing could be much
worse. I didn't get an hour's sleep. I was
dozing as you came in. Don't say anything
about it. Remember your promise ! But
I am sure I am breaking down. I am
certain I shall break down mentally
soon."

Nonsense ! " cried O'Brien, cheerfully.
I am not going to listen to that rubbish
in the noonday."

'sand a beautiful noonday it is," said
O'Hanlon, looking out into the meagrely
illumined back-yard, with its grass-green
water-butt resting unevenly on its grass-green

stand ; its flower-pots three-quarters
full of completely sodden clay ; its brokenhearted,
lopsided, bedraggled whisk, reclining
dejectedly partly against the humid
white wall and partly against the bulged
and staring water-butt ; its dilapidated
wooden shed that did not go through the
farce of sheltering anything from the
'universal moisture save a battered watering-pot
without a rose ; and its ghastly 
arbor vice — a shrub which makes
even summer sunshine look dull.

'Tve been looking over the papers
you lent me, and I had a chat with
Gorman before I came into this room.
Gorman told me more of Davenport and
long ago than I knew up to this. But
I can make nothing of your old client,
and am sure the apparition was the result
of pure nervous relaxation."

"But, confound it, my dear O'brien,

VOL. II. F

can't you see extreme mental relaxation is
what I am in dread of ? "

Well, then, I won't say tint. ^ Fll say
it was pure or impure liquor, or liver, or
anything: you like. Of only one thins
am I sure — namely, that there was more
than a little between this Fahey and
Davenport."

That's my own impression too ; but
I can make nothing of these documents."


"It is not intended you should be able
to make anything of them ; and if I were
you, now that the two men concerned in
them are dead and done for, I'd bother no
more about them."

Get it out of your head for good and
all, O'Brien, that I am troubling about
the men. I am not; I am troubling
about myself. I am afraid I am going
to have something seriously wrong with
my brain, and that's not a comfortable

thing for a man who is not yet old to get
into his mind,"

Well, Tm sure I don't know what todo.
I have often heard it said that one
of the best ways to adopt in a case
of this kind is to bring the man face to
face with the thing which causes him

annoyance "

What ! Bring me face to face with
what I saw ! I think, O'Brien, your brain
is giving way before merely the story of
my troubles."

No, no ; I mean to set you face to face
with the scene of your adventure, and then
when you perceive nothing unusual there,
you will be less disturbed by the memory
of your last visit than you are now. I
myself am curious to look at the place
once more. Will you drive over with
me now, and put your mind at rest forever
? "

He spoke earnestly, considerately.

2 F

O'Hanlon thought a moment, and then
said with a sigh, followed by a lugubrious
smile :

I don't know about putting my mind
at rest, but I think the drive would dome
good. I have been staying too much
indoors of late. Yes, I'll go. I'll be ready
in half-an-hour. Call for me then, aud
I'll have a car waiting outside. I hope the
weather will keep up."

O'Brien called at the time appointed, and
they drove away towards Kilcash.

When they cleared the city, their road
lay through miles of bog and marsh, in
which nothing grew but flags and osiers
and bulrushes, with here and there patches
of thin rank grass. The causeway along
which they drove had been formed of
the earth obtained from cuttings on each
side of it, and these cuttings made long
straight lines of dreary canals, cheered
by traffic. Snipe, and duck, and cranes

were to be seen here, but the ground was
rotten, and, in places, dangerous. As far
as the eye could reach no human habitation
was to be seen. On one of these
canals a poor hare-brained enthusiast had
built a small mill, now fallen into the
last stage of decay. The useless water
had no power to turn the useless wheel.
Now and then a bald gray rock rose a
few feet above the flat monotony of the
swamp. To right and left, low green hills
touched the leaden sky. All in front and
behind was cheerless, unbroken morass.

The air was heavy with moisture, but
no rain fell. The iron rails, woodwork,
and cushions of the car were clammy to
the touch. The horse's head drooped ashe
plodded spiritlessly along the dark,
miry road. The driver wore an oilcap, oilskin
coat, and had a heavy, sodden, yellow
rug about his knees. He used the whip
with monotonous regularity and monotonous

absence of result. The horse seemed
to feel that not even man could be in a
hurry on such a day. There was no movement
in sky, or air, or on the land. The
car startled two cranes that were fishing
by the side of the road. They rose and
tied with such intolerable slowness as proclaimed
their belief that no creature which
had once gone beneath could ever get from
under the flat pressure of those purposeless
clouds — could ever shake off the slimy
unctuousness of the land.

The two travellers sat back to back,
holding their heads forward against the
soft, clinging, clammy air. They scarcely
spoke a word the whole way. The landscape
afforded no subject for pleasant remark,
and the younger man did not
care to make matters gloomier. He had
nothing new to communicate, so he smoked
in silence. The elder mau could not rouse
himself to take an interest in any subject

not immediate to himself, and the driver
was half asleep.

At last the ground began to rise very
gradually. They were getting near the
sea. The air grew lighter, fresher, brisker.
A thin white vapour lay upon the
marsh and rolled slowly inward, yet no
wind could be felt. The air had grown
much warmer, and although the dull pall
of leaden sky still spread unbroken above,
it could be felt that sunlight existed somewhere
overhead. The bleak vacuity of an
-overcast winter day was being insensibly
filled with assurances of activity and life,
and from the wide sweep of the full horizontal
front there was the breath, the
inchoate murmur as though the leaves of
a hundred thousand trees felt the approach
of wind. That was the fine, broad, opening
phrase of the diapason tones drawn by
the ocean from the shore in its portentous
prelude to the silence of eternity.

Higher and higher they crawled slowly,
gradually, until they could tell what part
of the sky lay over the sea by reason of
its greater whiteness.

And now the various movements in the
orchestra of the sea began to assemble
and marshal before their ears. Here the
shrill silver hiss of the long waves toppling
in curved cascades, and running
swiftly inland on the sand. Here the
roar and rattle of stubborn boulders torn
from their rocky holds by the mad outward
of the shattered wave. Here the
low hollow groaning of protesting caves,
vocal, inscrutable. Afar off the deep
boom of the mighty wave, which, gliding
up to the land, a green, unbroken mound
of water, flung itself in white, impotent
rage against the repining, appalled,
forlorn cliffs, and made the air thunder
with mutinous clamour.

There was no storm — nothing beyond the
ordinary winter roller of the Atlantic.

The car stopped, and the two friends
descended.

It's only a few hundred yards from
this to the cliff over the Black Rock,"
said the driver. "But it's lonely thereon
a day like this. Don't go down.
Don't trust yourself on that rock a day
like this. She may begin any minute a
day like this, and if she catches you.
between her and the water, you're dead
men."

The two friends struck across the downs.
the younger leading the way.

THE ROCK.

Here was the dull blue wintry sea under
the dull gray wintry sky. No wind blew,
no rain fell. A thin, soft sea moisture
rose from the sea and met a thin, soft
cloud moisture descending from the clouds.
The long, even roller of the Atlantic stole
slowly, deliberately, sullenly, from the level
plains of the ocean, growing to the eye
imperceptibly as it came. The water was
thickly streaked with tawny, vapid froth ;
the base of the high, impassable, brown
rocky coast was marked by a broad but
diminishing line of yellow foam.

No bird was visible in the air, no ship
on the sea, no living creature on the land
but the two men, O'Hanlon and O'Brien.
A mile inland stood lonely Kilcash House,
which had for years been the home of
the dead man and his beautiful wife.
Below, between the towering, oppressive,
liver-coloured cliffs and the foam-mantled,
blanched blue sea lay the Black Rock, a
huge, flat, monstrous table cast off by the
land and spurned by the sea.

For a while the two men stood speechless
on the edge of the cliff overlooking the
barren waste of heaving waters and the
sullen ramparts of indomitable heights.
The deep boom of the bursting wave, the
roar of the outshine boulders, and the
shrill hiss of the falling spray, made the
dismal scene more deserted and forlorn.
The sea and cliffs were forbidding to man.
They seemed to resent the presence of
man — to desire, now that they were not

engaged in actual war, no intrusion on
the lines where their gigantic conflicts
were waged.

The Black Rock stretched out half-awhile
from the base of the cliff into the
sea, and was half-a-mile wide. Above it
the land was slightly hollowed towards
the sea, and would, but for the Black
Rock beneath, form a bay-like indentation
in the shore. The chord of this arc was
about six hundred yards, so that the
greater mass of the Black Rock projected
into the sea beyond the heads of the
cliffs.

The Rock, as it was called for brevity
in the neighbourhood, was only a few feet
above the reach of the waves and broken
water when a strong wind blew from the
south-west. It shelved outward, and when
the waters were very rough, when a storni
raged, the shattered waves leaped up on
it, and bounded, hissing in irresistible fury.

"towards the inner cliff, but were arrested,
dispersed, and poured down the sides of
the Rock ere they reached the inner cliff.
The Kock was highest at the centre, and
descended to right, left, front, and rear.
But although it was lower at the rear
than in the centre, it was much higher
there than in front. Viewed from above,
it was not unlike the back of some prodigious
sea monster rising above the surface
of the water. In shape it resembled a
vast creature of the barnacle kind, the
.apex of whose shell would represent ther
highest point of the Rock, and the corrugations
stand for the ridges and hollows of
the sides from the highest point of the
ledge to the lower ones.

The colour, too, was not unlike that of
41 barnacle. For, although the people had
given it the name of the Black Rock, it
was black only by comparison with the
cliffs. The surface was made up of smooth,

slimy ridges, dark blue-green in the hollows,
growing lighter as the curve sloped upward,
and on the summit, here and there,
deep yellow brown or oak.

Winter or summer, the Rock was never
quite dry. It was always damp, clammy,
treacherous. It was always dangerous to
the foot. There was no fear of one who
fell slipping into the sea, unless the
misfortune occurred very near the brink.
Then a fall and a plunge were certain
death, for the great rollers of the ocean
would grind or dash the life out of a
man against these rocks in a few minutes.
But many a man had slipped and hurt
himself badly, and two fatally, on that
cruel Black Rock.

Once a man of the village of Kilcash
had fallen, broken his leg in two places,
and been carried up the cliff path and
across the downs to die. Another had
slipped on the top of one ridge. For a

moment his body swept backward in an
arc like a bent bow, until his head
touched the top of the next ridge behind.
All his muscles instantly relaxed,
his chin was crushed down upon his
chest, he rolled for an instant into a
shapeless heap, rolled down into the
trough, and lay at full length with dead,
wide open eyes turned upward to the
sun. Several people had from time to
time met with dire accidents on that
dangerous slope by reason of the uncertain
footing it afforded.

But the great terror of the Black Rock
did not lie in the greasiness of its sur-^
face. The chief danger lay below the
surface. The deadly monster of that
desolate tract was hidden from view,
until suddenly, and generally without
warning, it sprang forth upon its victim,
and seized him and bore him away to
certain and awful death. It gave na

chance of respite or rescue ; it gave no
time for thought or prayer. One moment
^ man in the full vigour of life, full of
the pride of life, full joy in life, stood
upon that awful field of slippery rock,
and the next was caught from behind
and dragged into the foaming sea by a
force no ten men could fight against fora
moment.

All the year round this terrible monster
of death lurked here, and upon provocation
would rush out, and, when opportunity
offered, invariably destroy. It
could not be drowned with water or scared
by fire, or slain with lethal weapons. It
could not be lured or trapped. It would
some to an end no one knew when. It
had begun to exist centuries ago. It
varied in length with the season of the
year, and in bulk with the phases of the
moon. It had its lair in a cave. No boat
along all that coast durst enter the Whale's

Mouth for fear of it; for although much
could be foretold of its habits, all could
not. No one could infallibly predict for
an hour what it would do— except one
thing : that any boat in that cave when
it did appear would infallibly be dashed
into a thousand splinters. That was the
only thing certain about it. To be caught
in its cave would, if possible, be still more
terrible than to be caught by it on the
Black Kock.

Its dimensions varied from twenty to
a hundred and fifty feet one way by ten
to twelve and six to eight another.

Along the whole coast it was spoken of
with fear. Nothing else like it was known
in those parts. It was one of the sights
which made holiday makers seek the
secluded fishing of Kilcash. The inhabitants
knew its ways better than strangers.
And yet people of the village had fallen
a prey to its fury. More than a dozen

YOL. II. G

villagers had within four generations died
in its deadly embrace, and more than
an equal number of visitors within the
same period. Suppose the season visitors
had been at their highest number all the
year round, it had been calculated that
forty of them would have been sacrificed
in the time.

Over and over again visitors had been
warned against going near the place ;
but the attraction of danger proved too
strong for prudence, and people would go
for mere bravado or out of morbid curiosity.
The chance of contracting a fatal malady
has no allurements for man : the prospect
of a violent death fascinates him. The
love of daring certain death by violence is
found in few ; the willingness to dare
great peril by violence is almost universal
in young men of healthy bodies and minds.
It has been justly said that the most extraordinary
contract into which large bodies

of men ever voluntarily enter is that by
which they agree to stand up in a field
and allow themselves to be shot at for
thirteen pence a day; and yet men risk
their lives daily willingly, a ta less price —
nay, for no price at all.

Here, on this very Black Rock, a terrible
instance occurred with disastrous result five
years before, when three young Trinity
College students were staying for the
summer vacation at Kilcash. They were
friends, and lodged in the same cottage.
They went on little excursions together.
Of course they had heard all about the
terrors of the Black Rock. In an hour
of eclipse they resolved not only to visit
the fatal Rock, but to lunch there under
circumstances of the greatest danger. They
mentioned their intention freely, and were
warned by the simple people of the village
that they ran a risk in going to the spot
they named, and at the time they selected,

G 2

and that they absolutely courted death by
delaying for luncheon. That afternoon one
of the three ran the whole way back into
the village and told the appalling tale. He
had strayed a few yards from his friends,
when suddenly burst upon his ears a thunderous
roar. The Kock shook beneath his
feet as though it would burst asunder. He
was instantly covered and blinded with
mist and sea smoke. He gave himself up
for lost, and instinctively ran towards the
cliff. Then he heard a fearful crash of
waters, and again the Rock shook. He
wondered his destruction had been so long
delayed. He waited until all was still. He
turned round. His friends had disappeared.
Their bodies were never recovered.

As it has been said, the Black Rock was
not in reality black, but a dark, dirty olive
green. Perhaps it got its name from the
dark or black deeds which had been enacted
on it.

Around the Black Kock the cliffs do not
stand very high. They reach to little more
than a hundred feet above the solid shelf
below. In colour they are of a deep liver
hue. They lean outward and take the form
of huge broad broken pilasters, set against
an irregular wall. These cliffs, like the
Rock, are always damp, but, unlike the
Rock, never clammy. They are smooth and
flat, with sharp angles and rectangular
fractures. They are cold and hard, and
seem built by nature to define for ever the
frontier of the ocean.

At the point of the Rock furthest inland
the cliff is of a softer nature, and hence
the water has eaten deeper in here. The
cliff is part clay, part gravel, and part
boulder. Here is a temporary break in
the continuity of the regular formation.
There is no depression on the downs above
to correspond with this fault. Thus at the
back of what has been called the bay, there

are about two hundred yards long of cliff,
which the sea would soon tear away if it
could get at it. But the Black Rock stood
between the greedy ocean and the vulnerable
point of the cliff. It formed a
sufficient outpost. This part of the bay
slants inwards, not outwards, as the two
arms. In this part a little copper ore was
once found, and a shaft sunk. But the
mine proved of no practical value, and,
after absorbing much money, was abandoned
fifty years ago. The shaft was sunk
two hundred feet; but here, even if the
mine had proved rich, the water would
have presented serious difficulties, for after
getting down a hundred and twenty feet
it began to appear, and at a hundred
and fifty it occasioned delay and inconvenience.
Forty years ago the top of the
shaft had been covered with planks and
clay to prevent accident. Long ago the
machinery and wooden engine-house and

tool-house had been carried away, and now
the site of the head of the shaft was. indistinguishable
from the other bramble-grown
parts of the sloping cliff over the Black
Rock. This head of the mine was always
carefully avoided by the inhabitants, for
every one said some day or other the
planks were sure to give way and fall to
the bottom. It was of no interest whatever
to visitors, for nothing was to be
seen, and a landslip had destroyed the
rude road long ago made to it. It was
on the right-hand side of one looking
seaward.

On this inside of the bay of stone ran
downwards the path leading to the great
table below. It was a natural path almost
the whole way. Art of the simplest kind
had cut a little here and filled up a little
there, and levelled a little in another place,
but the lion's share of the work had been
found ready to man's hand. There was no

attempt at road-making, or attaining to a
surface. Those were luxuries of civilisation
: this was a work of rough art and
benignant nature.

As one faced the sea, the path crossed
over from left to right, then from right to
left, and finally from left to right. Standing
on the cliff at the middle point of the bay,
and looking down at the broad expanse of
slanting rock, only two things caught the
eye, when the dimensions, the colour, and
conformation had been taken in. Directly
in front, and almost in the middle of the
Kock, rose the apex of what has been
likened to the shell of a barnacle. It was
not more than ten feet above the level of
the Rock, twenty feet from its centre, and
was part of the Kock itself.

In a direct line with the apex, and about
half-way between it and the outer rim of
the Kock, there is a black spot which, upon
closer inspection, proves to be a hole of

some kind. At the distance it is impossible
to perceive any more.

Towards this hole O^Hanlon pointed his
arm, and said to O'Brien :

*' There s the Hole. You know it well
enough."

"Of course. But you could not recognise
him so far off," said O'Brien, shading
his eyes to look.

**No ; but I told you I saw him in here
quite close ; " and he pointed. *' He or it
went on without hesitation, and then
jumped in. He or it, whichever you prefer,
O'Brien, went in as sure as I have a head
on me. Either that or I am going
mad."

O'Brien thought awhile in silence, with
his hand on his chin and his eyes turned on
the bleak, dreary waste of stone and water
before him.

O'Hanlon, you're not afraid to risk
seeing anything — that thing again ? " he

asked at length — adding, " I want to have
a look at the place."

The other hesitated a little before he
drew himself up, and said :

"No. I may as well face it and be sure
of the worst — be certain whether I am to
end my days in a lunatic asylum or not."

The two men descended to the Black
Rock.

THE HOME OF THE MONSTER.

It was now growing dusk. The loneliness
of the place was extreme. A few sea-gulls
were wheeling and crying in the dull
air overhead. They had come back from*
their long day's fishing far out to sea and
up and down the coast, and were leisurely
wheeling, scouting, and sailing shoreward
to their homes among the crags.

Nothing else stirred or broke the stillness,
except the sea — the imperial, the insatiable,
the eternal sea ! — the sea that for ever
chafes and storms, and seeks to eat away
or overwhelm the land because it spurns

and writhes under its function of merely
filling up the hollows of earth and balancing
the volume of the world.

If all the solids of the earth were turned
smooth in the mighty lathe that drives the
earth round its axis, then water would be
supreme, and this planet would be a
polished, argent sphere, flashing through
interspaces between clouds as it spun and
flew along the orbit of gold woven of light
for it by the sun.

Day and night the waters work without
ceasing to overwhelm the earth. Day and
night the torrents tear down the sand and
boulders and trees of the mountains and
fling them into the hidden hollows at the
mouths of rivers. All the deltas of the
world are offerings of the torrents and
rivers towards carrying out the grand
scheme of the oceans metropolitan. Pool
and tarn and lake and inland sea, and
remotest waters that touch undreamed-of

isles, are daily and nightly fretting or
tearing away the uncomplaining shores.

The sun and moon and winds are leagued
against the pastoral earth. Daily the sun
transports millions of tons of water from
the harmless plains of deep-sea waters, and
the wind takes these vaporous foes of the
land and hurls them on the loftiest mountains,
so that they may gain the greatest
speed and rending force and carrying power
as they fly back with spoils of earth to their
old friend the sea. The sun splits the
cliffs with heat, and the winds lend fascines
to the waves, so that the injured portions
may be reached, cast down, and another
line of defence destroyed.

Lest the sun and the winds and the
rivers are not enough to accomplish the
ruin of man's territory, the moon — the
gentle moon of poets and lovers — the cold,
frigid moon helps with that coldest of
all things on earth, the glacier, to complete

the havoc. The power of the wind
is but partial, intermittent ; that of the
moon and the glacier general, everlasting.
The tides are the heights commanding the
outworks of the land ; the moving fields
of ice unsuspected traitors, in the garb of
solidity, sapping the walls of the citadel.

Even now the list of enemies is not
complete. In the core and centre of the
earth itself the arch-traitor, the mightiest
traitor of all, lies, gravitation, which should
naturally be the lieutenant of the denser
of the two combatants. This is the most
relentless, the most unmerciful leveller of
all. It seizes with equal avidity upon the
moat that the sunlight only makes visible ,
and the loosened but yet un apportioned
cliff of a thousand feet high, cut by the
river of a Mexican canon.

Electricity, the irresistible enemy and
imponderable slave of man, is on the side
of the waters. It binds the vapours of the

oceans together, and scatters them when
it reaches the hills. It rends trees and
stones and buildings, and flings them down
ready for easy porterage by the more
methodical water.

One of these forces that ought to be on
the side of the land, gravitation, has
deserted its own side for the water. It
is one force, and is universally operative.
One of these forces that ought to be on the
side of the sea has deserted its own side
for the land. It is one force, but it
operates through hundreds of thousands,
of millions of agents ; it is the coral insect.
It transmutes the waters which give life
and sustenance to it into land against
which the waters war. It raises up an
island where there ought to be two hundred
fathoms of water. It uses up more
material in making islands than all the
great rivers put together deposit at their
deltas.

The only loyal servant land has is the
central fire. It can throw up in one
minute as much as all the others can
tear down in a hundred years. The
central fire pushes an ocean aside with
as much ease as a wave raises a boat.
It throws up the Andes in less time than
it took the sea, with its allied forces, to
rob England of Lyonnesse.

The coral insect and the central fire,
the least and the hugest of the world's
working forces, are more than equal to
all the forces arrayed against them, and
are the humble and the terrible friends
of man.

Here, by this gloomy sea, no coral
insect toiled, no earthquake heaved, no
volcano thrust up a flaming torch of hope
to heaven. Here the enemies of the land
had no foe to encounter but the resolute
indifference of the veteran cliffs. Here the
sea, and the tides, and the winds, and gravitation

worked on unchallenged by active
resistance. Year after year, almost imperceptible
pieces of cliff fell, were engulfed.
Year after year the incessant action of
the waves was gnawing deeper and deeper
into the heart of the land. Year after
year the adamantine substance of the
Black Kock was diminishing, though
in a generation no man noticed a change
in the Rock, and few a change in the cliff.

This coast was honeycombed with caves.
In the summer time, when the weather
was fine, pleasure parties put off from
Kilcash . for "The Caves," as the district
in which they were to be found was, with
peculiar want of fancy or imagination in
so imaginative a race, called by the
inhabitants of the village.

The region of caves was all to the east
of Kilcash, and extended along several
miles of coast. Some caves were wide-mouthed,
shallow, low, uninteresting ;

VOL. II. H

others spacious, lofty, ramified. In order
to excite curiosity and inspire awe, some
were reported to be unexplored ; others had
legends. Others had sad stories of truthful
tragedies. It was safe to enter one at low
water only, and safe to stay no longer thana
few minutes because of the stalactites. If
you wished to see another, and not stay in
its black, chill maw for four hours, you
must go on the top of high water, and stay
no more than a good hour. To a third you
might go at any time of tide. To a fourth
only on the last of the lowest of neaps, and
then be quick and get away again. To a
sixth only on the top of spring tides. To
one, and one only, which might be entered
at any state of tide — Never.

This last cave, which not the boldest
fisherman in Kilcash or the next village toit
would face, was called the Whale's Mouth,
and ran in under the Black Rock.

The opening of the Whale's Mouth is on

the south-west or extreme seaward side of
the Black Rock. At full of spring tide the
entrance to it is about fifteen feet high and
of equal breadth. The difference between
high and low water here is about fifteen
feet. Hence, at lowest of spring tide,
the measurement from the surface of the
water to the roof at the entrance would
be thirty feet.

At the entrance of the Whale's Mouth
the outline of the Black Rock is blunt,
abrupt, solid. The base of the Rock is
never uncovered by water. The wash of
the long roller of the Atlantic is always
against its sides. The general formation
of the cave is that of a square. It is
more like the hideous distended jaws of
the crocodile than of the whale ; but the
reason for calling it the Whale's Mouth does
not lie in the immediate entrance, but
further on, in the roof of the forbidding
cavern.

h2

For years no one had dared to enter
that cavern. Along the coast were stories
of two boats which had ventured in. ^ Nota
plank, oar, or man of the first had
ever been seen again. Part of the boat,
oars, and crew of the other had been
seen for one brief moment, smashed and
mangled, and then disappeared for ever.
What the fate of the former was no one
could tell ; what the fate of the latter had
been all knew.

As far as could be seen into the cave
from the outside, there was nothing dangerous
or remarkable-looking about it. It
declined slightly in height, but the walls
did not seem to come any closer together.
There was no rock or obstruction of any
kind visible in it. The long, even swells
rolled in unbroken; but after each wave
passed out of sight there was a deep
tumultuous explosion, and a strange, loud
sound of rushing and struggling water.

There was no weakening or gradual dispersion
of the force of the wave. Its
power seemed shattered and absorbed at
once.

This cave had another mysterious and
disquieting faculty* It absorbed and discharged
more water than could be accounted
for by any other supposition but that inside
somewhere it expanded prodigiously.
At flood tide the water went in eagerly ;
at ebb tide it ran out at so quick a rate,
many believed a large body of fresh water,
or foreign water of some other kind, found*
a way into it. On flood tide, the fishermen
gave it a wide berth, lest by any
chance or mischance they might be sucked
into it.

Often curious people passing by at flood
tide threw overboard articles that would
float, and watched them as they were
slowly but surely drawn into that
gaping vault. There was no doubt they

were swallowed by that inky void, but
they never were seen by man again.
Some of the simpler people believed
that there was a whirlpool at the end
of the cave, and that if this whirlpool
took anything down, it never gave that
thing, or sign or token of that thing,
back again. People on these shores
attach miraculous powers to whirlpools.
There are no whirlpools of consequence
in the neighbourhood, but terrible stories
of them had reached the people, and
filled the simple folk with superstitious
awe.

In this shunned and mysterious cell
the rock-monster had its home. On the
sea it was harmless. But no one durst
enter its haunt, and yet this was not
wholly from fear of the monster, but of
the place itself, with its loud explosions,
its unaccountable indraught and outflow,

and the returning dead of the two
boats. The monster had its home in the
cave ; but his sphere of action was on
the vast plain of rock above.

O'Hanlon and O'Brien succeeded in
crossing the Black Rock without accident,
and were drawing near the Hole.

*rit was there," said O'Hanlon, pointing
"just there. I saw him as plain as
ever eyes saw anything."

O'Hanlon pointed to the north-east, or
shore side, of the Hole.

The two men drew nearer, and then,
pausing a moment to fix their hats firmly
on their heads and grasp one another
round the waist, crept cautiously forward
until they stood on the brink of the
Hole. They looked down.

The Hole was almost square, about
thirty feet by thirty feet, and narrowing
irregularly as it went down to about

half that size. The depth from where
the two stood to the surface of the water
below was thirty-five feet.

The bottom of the Hole was naturally
scant of light, and the light now in the
sky was poor and thin.

The sides were almost smooth, and at
the bottom of the funnel the angles a
little rounded in. The rock upon which
they stood seemed to be about twenty-five
feet thick, and the free space between
the bottom of the rock and the surface
of the water ten feet. Thus the height
of the cave at the Hole was at the
present time of tide — half-tide flood — ten
feet.

At the bottom of the Hole the water
was no longer smooth, even quiet, but
broken and turbid, opaque, and mantled
with froth. Every wave that entered the
vestibule of the cave swung the uneasy
seething mass inward, to return in a few

seconds on the back wash. But the froth
did not come back every time; it crept
further on, until at the third wave the
froth disappeared inward, to be succeeded
by other froth moving at the same rate.

It made one giddy to look for any
length of time. After a few minutes
both men drew back by mutual consent.

"No mortal man could live down therefor
five minutes," said O'Hanlon, with a
shiver.

*' No," said O'Brien, with a laugh, "or
ghost either, for that matter. But, I say,
O'Hanlon, what cool and roomy lodging
it would afford to all the Fishery Commissioners
in the United Kingdoms ! "

This is no place > for joking," said
O'Hanlon, uneasily. " Let us get back.
I am sick of this place."

Wait a minute," said O'Brien. " As
this wretched man Fahey was seen here
both in the flesh and the spirit for the

last time, let me read the documents he
left in your charge."

He put his hand in his pocket, and read
the papers by the fast-fading light.

"Come on. Take care you don't slip.
The papers are simple enough on the
surface, except No. 11. Shall I read it
to you ? "

'•'Ay," answered O'Hanlon absently.

It was nothing to him. He was devoting
his thoughts to getting safely over this
greasy, clammy, slippery surface.

O'Brien read out slowly :

' Memorandum. — Else 15*6 lowest. At
lowest minute of lowest forward with all
might undaunted. The foregoing refers
to sculls. With only one skull any lowest
or any last quarter ; but great forward
pluck required for this. In both cases
(of course!) left.'

'well," said O'Brien, "I confess I
can't make anything of it. Can you?"

"No," said the other listlessly.

They had now reached the foot of the
path.

"I think it's rubbish. What do you
say?"

"Unmitigated rubbish."

What, for instance, can he mean by
skull ' and ' sculls ' with a line under
each? The writing is that of a man of
some education."

Oh, yes — he was a man of some
education."

O'Brien paused in his walk, and cried :

Stop ! I think I have an idea."

"Eh?"

"From what you know of this man,
do you think he could spell a word of
ordinary English?"

I should think so."

"Then I have an idea.

"What is it?"

KILCASH.

O'Brien and O'Hanlon gained the top of
the cliff, and reached the car waiting on
the road without saying anything further.
the former was busy with his thoughts ;
the latter, after O'Brien's word "Wait,"
sank into indifference.

I'm ashamed of two sensible men such
as you," said the driver, in a southern
brogue, *' going down there on an uncertain
season like this, and at the end
of daylight. It's a mercy you ever got
back alive."

'' Or dead," said O'Brien, with a laugh.

** Never mind, Terry ; we're none the
worse for it. Now, drive on to Kilcash,
and pull up at the Strand Hotel."

The driver whipped his horse, and the
remainder of the journey was accomplished
in silence.

Kilcash is a small, straggling village,
built on the slopes of the cliffs surrounding
Kilcash Bay, and on the low ground
lying in front of the bay. In summer it
is usually pretty full of people, for although
no railway has yet reached it, hundreds
of families live in the neighbourhood, and
many who dwell at a distance use it asa
holiday resort. In winter it is dreary,
deserted, dead. The closed-up lodging-houses
and cottages which, under the influence
of the summer sun, grow bright
and cheerful with flowers and the faces
of children, in winter stare with blank
window eyes at the cold gray sky and
monotonous level of the sea. It was difficult

to say who governed Kilcash — five
policemen and seven coast guardsmen, possibly
; for there was no other sign of
official life.

There was no Corporation, no Commissioners
under the Towns Improvement
Act, no gas-house, no water-works, no
sanitary board, no guardians of the poor, no
bellman, no watering-carts, no workhouse,
no police-court, no tax or rate collector, no
exciseman, no soldier, no lawyer. There
were only three institutions, and these were
curative — namely, two houses of worship
of different denominations, and a dispensary.


Indirect taxation reached the people
occultly ; of direct taxation they knew
nothing. No doubt some one paid for
mending their sewer when the rain-water
of winter burst it. No doubt some one
paid for putting metal on the roads when
the ruts became absolutely dangerous.

No doubt some one paid the men who
built up the breach in the Storm Wall.
There was a slumbering belief that the
police had powers, and the coastguards
functions. For instance, the police fished
a good deal, smoked fairly well, and were
respectable with haughtiness. The coastguards
had a boat. In the eyes of
Kilcash the possession of a boat was
sufficient to account for anything in
the world. The coastguards went out in
their boat only in fine weather, which
gave them the aspect of gentlemen. They
kept their boat scrupulously mopped and
painted — painted, not tarred; which was
foppish, and a little weak-minded. They
carefully displayed in the station on the
hill, carbines and cutlasses of which Kil-cash
stood in no more awe than it did
of the bulrushes in the bog at the back
of the village. To be sure, there was a
theory that upon occasion the police might

call on the coastguards to come out
and assist them. But what this occasion
was no one knew. Sergeant Malone had
been heard to hint broadly that in such
a dire extremity — which would not, he
said, curdle his blood in the least — the
chief command would devolve on him.
Although nothing was known for certain
as to the exigency which might place the
whole offensive and defensive forces of
the village under the command of Malone,
Tim Curran had, when going home late
of an evening, said he supposed the landing
of the French in Dublin Bay would lead
to that extraordinary act of power. Tim
had been in Dublin for three days, and
was believed to be infallible on all matters
connected, or that might ever be connected,
with the bay — from herrings to
the French Fleet. It must not be deduced
from this that Kilcash assumed a
very servile attitude towards Dublin; for

if Dublin had a bay, so likewise bad
Kilcasb.

In the village there was one secret held
by all, known by all, but scarcely once ina
lifetime spoken of by one neighbour to
another. It is more than likely that this
secret would never have been dreamed of
only for a fool once famous in the village,
now long since dead. And even this fool
told the secret to but few. For a reason
lost in the obscurity of local dulness, this
fool was named "The Prince of Orange."
He went about barefooted, in the most
gaudy raiment he could beg. He preferred
a soldiers or a huntsman's cast-off coat to
any other, and if he was fortunate enough
to get such a garment, he stitched to it
all the blue, yellow, and green ribbons he
could lay hands on. He was one of the
villagers killed by the monster of the Black
Rock. On the outer face of it the fishing
was generally good for long lines, and one

VOL. II. I

day, while making believe to fish therewith
an old brace and a piece of tattered
ribbon tied together, he was surprised and
overwhelmed.

The great secret of the people of Kilcash
was that no man, woman, or child of the
whole village could understand why people
came there in summer. Of course the
advent of the visitors filled the pockets
of the inhabitants, which was no more
than the inhabitants were entitled to expect,
which was no more than natural,
since it has been so for generations. But
why should people come to Kilcash in the
summer months ? It was said they came
to the sea. But why ?

Supposing a sailor had been at sea for
three years and then came home to Kilcash,
did he want to look at the land ? Did
any one in the world ever want to seethe
land? These people who came with
the long, hot days had near their own

homes lakes or rivers, or pools or wells.
All these were water — nothing but water.
There was salt in one, and not in the
other — that was all the difference. Put a
bucket of sea-water beside a bucket of
fresh, and who could tell the difference
without tasting or smelling ?

When a man came back from a three
years' cruise, did he go straight off into
the country and stand or lie staring at
the fields and haystacks ? Not he. Either
he came home to Kilcash, or went to a big
town where he could see strangle shorts and
buy fine things with his wages. Some came
to fish. To fish ! Why, every gurnet they
caught cost them about a pound of money.
The doctors told them to come for health.
Health ! What did they think of rheumatism,
and fever, and bronchitis, and
pleurisy, and lumbago, and other diseases,
a thousand times worse at the sea
than inland ? Did any one ever know

the land to kill a man ? How many
thousands a year did the sea kill ? In
the heat of summer it was all very well
to bathe, and swim, and lie about on the
sands and rocks, to wade and tumble
into pools and get drenched with spray.
But wait until the winter comes. Wait
until they get the wages of their summer
folly. Wait until they are racked by
pains, and choked with a cough, and
crippled with stiff joints. When they
feel the penalties they are far from the
place where they incurred them, and the
fools of doctors tell them they must go
back to the sea next summer in order to
get finally rid of their maladies ! Rubbish.
In reality they come to the sea to drive
in the few nails still wanting in their
coffins.

This secret made the people of Kil-cash
conscious of being hypocrites, and
accounted for the forced smile with which

they greeted visitors in summer, and the
night of leaden gloom which descended
on them when the visitors departed for
the year. The inhabitants of Kilcash
never smiled in winter. To laugh in
winter would have sounded like a paean
over their miserable, misguided visitors.
It would have indicated a heartless and
brutal nature.

O'Brien and O'Hanlon alighted at the
*' Strand Hotel," and ordered dinner and
beds. During dinner, O'Hanlon made
two ineffectual attempts to extract O'Brien's,
idea from him, but the latter would not
speak. He smiled, and repeated his former
word " Wait." O'Brien in his turn
tried to induce O'Hanlon to talk, but the
latter answered in the briefest and most
apathetic way. The dinner was finished
in absolute silence.

When it was over, O'Brien rose and
said :

''' You won't mind my going out for an

hour or so

»'

** Going out ! " cried O'Hanlon, rousing
up. " Where on earth are you going at
such an hour, in such a place ? Not to that
accursed Black Rock ? "

"No, no," said O'Brien. "Only I'm
quite sure you would never dream of entering
such a place, I would ask you to come
with me."

What place ? "

Oh, you're too respectable for it, I assure
you."

"Nonsense! I'll go with you."

"I'll lay you a sovereign you don't."

Done ! "

Done! I'm going to the *Blue Anchor'
to drink a pint of beer and smoke a pipe of
tobacco. Hand over the money."

"The 'Blue Anchor'— the Blue 'Anchor!'
Are yoic out of your mind too, or are you
joking ? Oh, I know ! You want to get

rid of me for an hour, but don't like to says."


I have a bet of a sovereign on it, and
rjl take the money now, if you like. Will
that convince you ? "

'* No ; I'll pay when you come back and
tell me you have been there. But if you
really are going to that low beershop, tell
me what you are going there for."

'amusement. I find you dull."

O'Hanlon screwed up his eyes and regarded
O'Brien closely.

What is it ? " he asked. • '

He knew O'Brien much too well to think
he meant to be offensive, or even smart at
the expense of an old friend without good
reason. He suspected O'Brien was waiving
a direct answer, which might cause pain to
his hearer.

*' It's something you suspect, and don't
like to tell me. You're not going over to
the dispensary to ask Dr. Flynn to drop in

presently, as though by accident, and find
me here, and make an informal examination
? ''

This was said half-playfully.

'stake care," said O'Brien, as he buttoned
on his overcoat. " If you don't
knock off talking about your infernal
sanity, you'll drive one mad ; and won't
that be a nice kettle of fish ? Now look
here : Are you, or are you not, coming
with me to the ' Blue Anchor ' to smoke a
frugal pipe and drink a frugal pint of
beer — or, more correctly, a pint of frugal
beer ? Yes or no ? "

"No," answered O'Hanlon, sinking back
hopelessly on the chair from which he
had risen. " It would be as much as my
professional position is worth."

All right, then ; I'm off. I'll be back
within an hour. Don't forget you owe
me a sovereign ; " and he left the room.

THE " BLUE Anchor."

The *blue Anchor" was certainly not a
place suited to the leisure moments of a
respectable solicitor enjoying first-rate practice
in an important town. It was small,
low, dingy, blear-windowed, dilapidated. It
stood in a little by-street, if a place like
Kilcash can be said to have a by-street,
since it has no main street or streets,
all streets being in some way or another
intimately connected with the Storm Wall,
as the road inside that work was called.

The "Blue Anchor" has no pretensions
to a " front." On one side of the door is

a small, square window filled with small
panes of unclean glass. The house is
two storeys high ; the ground-floor ^ consists
of three rooms — namely, the bar,
tap-room, and kitchen. The floors of
these three rooms are formed of beaten
clay, and boast of neither straw nor sand.
Within the bar are a plain deal table
and four chairs. By means of these, the
bar is, for the sake of gentility, used as
tl]e family refectory, for people of any
pretensions know that dining in the
kitchen is a sign of low origin. Opposite
the counter of the bar stands the door
into the tap-room. Folk who are in haste
can be served at the bar, but most of
the customers of the "Blue Anchor" are
strangers to haste, and take their liquor
seated in the tap-room — or tap, as it is
familiarly and affectionately called by those
who are familiar with the place. It is
about twelve feet square, with a large

deal table in the middle, and a bench on
each side of the table. At the upper end
is a hearth, on which smoulders a good
peat fire, the smoke from which goes up
a large flue that comes down to within
eve feet of the floor like a huge funnel.
Two short pieces of logs, the spoil of
some wreck, serve as chimney-seats. The
benches are of home-make, and very
unsteady on their legs. The continual
presence of beer seems to have muddled
them as to the exact position of their centre
of gravity ; and this condition, combined
with the deplorable unevenness of the
floor, has made them despair of ever being
able to find it out.

But the table is as firm as the Black
Rock itself John Tobin, the landlord —
an enormously fat man, in gaiters, knee-breeches,
and a cutaway-coat — takes great
pride in the invincible stability of that
table. Whenever he is angered by anything,

lie goes into the tap-room, places
his hands flat on the middle of the table,
and gives two, three, or four shakes,
according to the agitation of his feelings.
Then he goes out to the front door, looks
critically at the sky to seaward, comes
back to the bar, and, having mopped his
forehead, sighs, and is once more calm.

The wonder of every one in the village
is how the " Blue Anchor " manages to live,
and support John, his wife, and daughter.
In summer the men are too busy to go
often, except for a pint or two before
retiring for the night ; and in winter the
men have very little or no money to
spend.

When Jerry O'Brien reached the *' Blue
Anchor" he spoke a few cheerful words
to John Tobin, whom every frequenter
of Kilcash knew, told him he had run
out from Kilbarry for the evening, with
a view to seeing how things were in the

village, and how things were likely to
be there in the coming season. Jerry-did
not know exactly what the latter
phrase could mean, but it sounded friendly,
as though he took an interest in the place.

Old John instantly attached a definite
meaning to his words, and said, with a
smile :

Ah, sir, glad to hear it. Going to
marry, sir, and settle down and take a
house here for the season ? "

Jerry started a little, coloured a little,
and then said gaily :

No such luck, John — no such luck !
I meant about the fishing, you know.
I'll go in and smoke a pipe for a bit."

*sand welcome, sir," said the fat old
man, steering himself around the end of
the counter, and bringing his vast stomach
safely into view, with watch-chain, watch-key,
and seals swaying giddily from his
overhanging fob.

There were only two guests in the
"Blue Anchor." Both were smoking short
clay pipes ; each had a pint pewter pot
before him. Jerry nodded to each and
said "Good evening" before sitting down.
He called for a pipe and tobacco for
himself, and then asked if all, John Tobin
included, would have a drink, "because,
you know," said he, " as I never have
been here before, it is only fair I should
pay my footing," a speech which was
very cordially received. A wish was
expressed by John Tobin that since it
was the first time he hoped it wouldn't bethe
last. Upon which the two fishermen
applauded and cleared their throats in
anticipation of beer.

For a while O'Brien led the men to
speak of the prospects of the next season's
fishing, and the chances of its being a
good one. By the end of half-an-hour
they were ready for more beer. Then

he ceased to ask questions, and began to
talk:

"As I was coming along from Kilbarry
to-day, I told Tim to stop opposite the
Black Rock, and I and Mr. O'Hanlon, who
was with me, got down and went out en
it. I haven't been on it for I don't
know how long. Horrible place ! I suppose
very few people go over from the
village this time of year?"

"Very few. Only for the good fishing
there's off the tail of it, no one out of
the village would ever go there. It's a
cursed spot. I wonder you weren't afraid
to go down, sir, at such a time of year.
Ah, but when you were passing it was no
more than about half flood. There's not
so much danger at half flood as at full.
Were you to the southward of the Hole,
sir ? " said one of the fishermen.

"No. I took care of that. I may bea
fool, but I'm not such a fool as that. I

was curious to sec the place because of the
death of Mr. Davenport."

"Ah, yes," said John Tobit. ''He's
gone."

There was neither joy nor sorrow in
Tobin's voice, and that tone expressed the
general feeling of Kilcash towards the
event. It was nothing to the village,
neither good nor harm. He had been
little more than a name to them.

Well, you all remember an unfortunate
fellow named Fahey — Mike Fahey, wasn't
it ? — who went down the Hole of his own
free will, or, rather, when he was chased
by the police, ten or eleven years ago.
Of course you all remember him ? "

Oh, yes " — they all remembered him.

"Well, the affair of Mr. Davenport's
death put him in my mind, and I thought
we'd go and look at the place where he
took his awful leap. It nearly made me



\

giddy to look down, and sick to think of
his awful end."

*rand he wasn't in the wrong, after
all!" said John Tobin. "Mr. Davenport,
I will say, afterwards cleared the man's
character. That was good of Mr. Davenport,
wasn't it?"

"Yes," said O'Brien; "but why did
he make away with himself? If a man
knows he's innocent, he needn't run off
and drown himself. He must have remembered
Mr. Davenport gave him the
money. Why didn't he trust Mr. Davenport
to clear him?"

The three men shook their heads.

That's what puzzles me," said O'Brien.
"This unfortunate man was fond of fishing."

And little's the good he got by it,"
said one of the fishermen. "He had a
miserable cockleshell of a punt, and it
was the wonder of every one he wasn't

VOL. II. K

drowned seven days in the week. Nothing
would satisfy him but to keep dodging
about that Black Kock in his tub of a
punt, all by himself, and he not able to
swim a stroke. If he hadn't gone down
the Hole of his own will, he'd have been
drowned by his own foolishness some day."

"How used he to manage that boat?
With a sail?"

'' Sail ! No, sculls."

Did he pull well ? "

Not particularly well. Well enough,
though, for a raw-boned chap like him.
Now that I remember it, I think he was
pretty handy with the oars — for a spell,
you know. He'd be dead beat in a jim-crack
with a heavy oar in a yawl, but
he could fiddle pretty fairly with the
oars he carried."

"Did you ever see him scull from the
notch ? "

"Ay, I have, sir."

*sand was he handy from the notch,
too?"

"Yes, in a hop-o'-my-thumb cockleshell
like his. Why, you could twist her round
your finger in a mill-race. But as far as
I can remember, he could handle an oar
aft as well as most of those that weren't
brought up to the work from boys."

"And what happened to this miserable
punt of his ? "

Well, I don't think, sir, I can remember
that. I know he lost it in some
kind of way or other — west, I think he
said. Anyway, whether he said so or
not, it must have been west somewhere,
for if anything happened to the punt on
the east shore he'd never come back to
tell what it was, for there isn't a landing-place
there for anything from the sea but
gulls and curlews ; and even if he was
the strongest swimmer in the barony his
swimming would be no use to him, for

he could never get into Kilcash Bay —
never get round the head."

Although, as you say, the east is
much more dangerous than the west, isn't
it strange he should have lost his boat on
the west side ? "

Well, sir, it may and may not be
strange. You see the western coast is
more broken up, and there are more coves,
and little bays, and little strands, and
sharp rocks half covered, and so on, so
that he might stave her in there, and yet
manage to get ashore. I'm very sorry
I can't remember what became of the
punt."

"Never mind," said O'Brien. "Now,
do you know the exact rise and fall of a
neap tide at the Black Rock ? "

"The exact rise and fall?"

Yes ; the exact rise of a neap tide
from dead low water to the top of high
water."

"I could not say to the inch, Mr.
O'Brien."

*well, to the foot. I don't want it
to the inch ; the foot will do."

The fisherman consulted his companion,
who had not yet opened his mouth. After
a muttered talk, the spokesman said :

'' We wouldn't say to a foot, sir, if anything
of consequence depended upon it."

"Fill up the measures again, John'*
said O'Brien, whose pint stood before him
untasted. " There's no bet on it ; you
needn't be afraid. I'm only asking for
information. I may be coming round here
for the summer, and I just want to find
out all I can. How much do you think ? "

Fourteen to sixteen feet."

*' You don't think fifteen feet six would
be far out ? "

"No, sir. That's as near as can be.
But there's the wind to be taken into
account when you come to inches."

'how near were you ever to the Whale's
Mouth — I mean, what was the nearest?"

As close as that," he answered, stretching
out his hand at arm's length. He
added significantly — " On the ebb."

How wide is the Mouth ? "

I couldn't say exactly, sir. It's a place
we're rather shy of, as you know. I daresay
it's as big as this room."

You couldn't pull a yawl into it ? "

God forbid ! " said the man devoutly.
*two did go in, and one was swallowed
up into the bowels of the land, and the
other was broken into ten thousand
splinters. Pull a yawl in there ! I'd goto
the Canary Islands for life first."

"I don't mean to say would you, but
could you ? "

''No."

Why ? "

"For two reasons. In the first place,
there isn't room for the yawl and the oars ;

:and in the other place, I'd drop dead with
the fright. Heaven be between us and all
harm ! "

"Is the Mouth much too narrow to
allow a yawl to pull in ? "

^*Mr. O'Brien, I and every one in
Kilcash have a great wish for you, sir;
and if you're asking me these questions
with the intention of going into the
Whale's Mouth, I'll not answer another
one."

"Upon my word and honour, Phalanx
haven't the least intention of making
away with myself, or with anybody else, by
means of the Whale's Mouth. I am inquiring
simply for information, and perhaps
if I come here in the summer, I may ask
you to take care of me while I am having
a look for myself; but just at present I
want you to give me the benefit of what
you know. How much too small is it fora
yawl to pull in ? "

I couldn't say how many feet, but
some feet."

'ten?"

Hardly so many as that, but thereabouts''


O'Brien was silent for a while. He
looked down at the table, and made some
figures on it with his finger. The other
men talked together. At last he looked
up and said :

Tell me, Phelan, did you, in looking
into the Whale's Mouth, notice whether
it was straight, or inclined to the right
or the left?"

"It's quite straight, as far as you can
see."

*' Are you quite sure of that ? "

Certain."

O'Brien then turned the conversation
back into local channels again. Soon
after he took his leave, having by some
strange freak of preoccupation forgotten

to drink his beer, although he had smoked
his pipe like a man.

It was pitch dark. There was not a
star in the heavens ; no lights in the
village, save here and there the thin ray
of a rush light shining through the wet
window of some cottage. No phosphorescent
gleam came from the sea, but a mournful,
ghostly sound of wailing, as its waves,
reduced by their passage up the bay,
broke in diminished force against the flat,
uneventful sand. Here were none of the
grand organ tones heard near the lonely*
Black Kock, with its deadly legends,
hideous Hole, and irresistible monster.

But O'Brien did not want to hear the
sea now, either in its tame and civilised
musing or in its insane roar when
it flung itself unimpeded against the
barriers of its dominions. He was thinking
of the Black Kock, and of his sick
friend, Alfred Paulton ; and of O'Hanlon,

and of the fate of Mike Fahey, and of
Mr. Davenport, and of Tom Blake, and
of — of Madge — his Madge, as he called
her to himself, now that it was dark and
no one was near. His Madge !

All around him was dark, cold, vacuous ;
all within him was full of light and
warmth, and rich with figures in motion.
He could not keep his great company of
players in order at first. They hustled
and jostled one another in his mind — all
except Madge — his Madge ! She moved
apart from all the others, and the moment
she appeared all the others fled as though
abashed before her unstudied perfections.

Up to this he had never seriously concerned
himself about anything. He had
always been in fairly comfortable circumstances,
although never rich. He had
been brought up in the belief that he
need never take much more trouble about
the present or the future than an occasional

glance at his salmon weirs on the
river, and here he was now threatened
with the loss of those weirs, which formed
the backbone of his income — at a time,
too, when this income meant the one
thing he held dearest in the future —
Madge ! He had never been really in
love before ; there had been a few trifling
affairs, but up to this he had never made
up his mind to marry. That was the
great test. Then look at the way he was
mixed up in the Paulton and Davenport
affair! Alfred, Madge's brother, succours
Mrs. Davenport, and falls in love with
the widow. He, Jerry O'Brien, causes a
relapse in Alfred's case by some indiscreet
words spoken by him of Mrs. Davenport.
Then the Fishery Commissioners (whom
may perdition lay hold of and keep forever
!) come howling to him about those
weirs, and O'Hanlon tells him he must
come over to Ireland post-haste, or he'll

be picked dry as a bone by the Fishery
Commissioners (whom may perdition — as
before !) ; and no sooner does he set his
foot in Kilbarry than O'Hanlon placidly
confesses there is not so much need for
haste for a day or two, or perhaps more,
and that his (O'Hanlon's) real reason for
sending for him was because of the ghost,
or the ghost of a ghost, of one Mike
Fahey, who had been connected with the
Davenports ten or eleven years ago, and
had jumped into the Hole in the Black
Kock. A pretty complication, truly, for a
man to get into in a fortnight or three
weeks !

A pretty complication to get into, no
doubt ; but how would it all end ? Except
for poor Alfred's illness and the Fishery
Commissioners (whom — as before !), upon
the whole he rather liked it.

And now he must go back to O'Hanlon,
who would think him lost.

"I say, O'Hanlon/' he said, cheerfully,
as he got back to the coffee-room, " you've
won that sovereign, not I."

Did you go ? "

*' Yes. I went and ordered the beer ;
but, I'm blowed, I was so much amused
that I came away and left it drunk."

Amused ! What in the name of all
that is wonderful could amuse you at that
wretched beer-shop ? "

'' I was only picking up some facts about
your old friend, Mike Farewells

has any one seen him ? "

'* I met three men, and they had all
seen him."

In the name of heaven, when ? "

*' Ten or twelve years ago."

'soh!" groaned O'Hanlon. "And not
since i

"No."

"That's not much good for me, is
it?"

"Is it the fact that they have not

seen the ghost which strikes you as being

bad for you ? "

'eyes, O'Brien. You know something."
"No, I do not; but I hope to know.

I have learned something. But still —

wait"

ON THE CLIFF.

Next morning O'Hanlon went back by
himself to Kilbarry. Jerry O'Brien made
up his mind to stay a few days at Kilcash.
His last words to the perturbed attorney
were encouraging, reassuring. He would
divulge nothing, nor indicate the nature
of his hopes ; but he told O'Hanlon in a
confident manner that he might dismiss
all thought of his brain being affected.
I now," he said, " verily believe you saw
a ghost, the ghost of Mike Fahey, on the
Black Rock within the past month. Will
that satisfy you ? "

O'Hanlon shook his head.

"Tm in the old fix still. I don't believe
in ghosts ; neither do you, ^ I am
sure. You are saying this merely to quiet
my fears."

** You may trust me, I assure you. I
am not saying anything out of a desire
to quiet your fears. If I do not tell you
all, I am prevented from doing so only
by the want of conclusive evidence. I
shall hang about here until some more
evidence turns up. I really believe what
you saw was no figment of your own
brain."

They parted thus. O'Hanlon was little
satisfied, still he had no resource but to
endure. His faith in O'Brien was great
in everything save this one subject, which
so unpleasantly and threateningly engrossed
his thoughts. He was a man
of sanguine temperament, and now the

strength and impetuosity of his mind was
turned inward and preyed on his peace.

O'Brien had little or nothing to do. His
curiosity was strongly excited. Owing to
the uncertainty of the movements of the
Fishery Commissioners he could not leave
the country. His heart was in London ;
no hour went over his head that he did
not think of his friends there. He wrote
to Mr. Paulton, and to his great relief
heard that Alfred was gradually recovering,
and that Dr. Santley hoped to have his
patient up and about in a short time, his*
youth and good constitution favouring
rapid convalescence now that the acute
stage of the disease was passed. All at
Carlingford House were well, and joined
in sending kindest regards to him, and
hoped he would soon get rid of his troublesome
business, and run back to them.
There was a postscript to the effect that
Dr. Santley had just that moment pro-vol.

II. L

bounced Alfred out of danger, and said
that he hoped in a fortnight or three
weeks the invalid would be able to seek
change of air and scene — the two things
which would then be sufficient to ensure
his restoration.

O'Brien, upon reading this, struck the
table with his hand, and cried out :

Capital ! — capital ! Nothing could be
better ! This is the mildest climate in all
Europe. He shall come here. I'll runover
for him if all the Fishery Commissioners
whom Satan can spare were to
try and bar my way. The least I may
do after causing that relapse is to nurse
him for a while."

O'Brien had little or nothing to do in
Kilcash. No newspapers came to him from
London or Dublin. After luncheon he
walked every day along the downs as fur
as the Black Rock. There, when the
weather was fine, he lounged for an hour

or so, and then strolled back to the hotel,
where he read some book until dinner.

The "Strand Hotel" was of course deserted.
He was the only guest, and the staff
had been reduced to one maid-of- all work.

''If Alfred wants quiet," thought Jerry,
grimly, "he can have it here with a vengeance.
As long as those wretched Commissioners
are about, I could not stand
Kilbarry. I'd be an object of commiseration
there, and I can't bear commiseration.
If I only had Alfred here I'd be as happy
as a king. But until he comes I must try
and keep up an interest in O'Hanlon's ghost.
I begin now to think O'Hanlon is going
mad, after all ; for I can neither hear nor
see anything of the late Mr. Fahey. It
wouldn't do to tell my misgivings to
O'Hanlon. He really is cut up about that
spectre, and the only way to keep his spirits
up is by professing an unbounded belief in

his phantom. '■'

L 2

No doubt Kilcasli was dull, and would
have been found intolerable by any one not
used to such a place at such a time. But
O'Brien had been brought up close to the
sea, and its winter aspect was as familiar
to him as its summer glories.

In summer, the sun and the clouds and
the genial warmth of the air take the mind
off the sea, and reduce it to a mere accessory
to the scene. It is only one of many
things which claim attention. In winter
the sea is absolute, dominant — master of the
scene. In its presence there is nothing to
take the mind away from it. The land and
the air and the clouds have suffered change :
the sea is alone immutable. It is not then
the adjunct to a holiday. In winter and
summer its colour is the result of reflection ;
but the dull, gloomy colours it reflects in
winter seem more congenial to it than the
vivid brightness of gayer skies.

From his childhood O'Brien had been

familiar with every phase of change that
possesses the watery waste. There was for
him no loneliness by the shore. He was no
poet in the ordinary sense of the word. He
had never tried to string rhymes together.
He considered that a man who deliberately
sat down to write verses which were not
intended purely to bring in money must be
in a bad state of health. He never concerned
himself with elaborate analysis of his
feelings, or moaned because the destinies
had not ordained splendours for his career.
He wished the Commissioners would let his'
weirs alone, so that he might marry Madge
Paulton. He wanted to lead a quiet, unromantic
life. He felt much more relief
in abusing the Commissioners than he
should feel in writing a mournful ditty
against fate.

But he was in love, and dwelling by
the sea in winter. He had inadvertently
caused his dearest friend a serious relapse

in illness, and he was asked by another
friend to help him over a horrible suspicion
that this other friend had of his
own sanity. Here surely was matter for
abundance of thought. So that, on the
whole, he had no moment of the day
that was not filled with engrossing reflection
of some kind or another.

He answered Mr. Paulton's letter at
once. He was overjoyed to hear the good
news of Alfred, and he had made up
his mind beyond any chance of alteration
that the finest place in the world for
Alfred would be the south of Ireland,
and that there was no spot in the south
of Ireland at all equal to Kilcash for anyone
who needed recruiting. Then he sent
his very kindest regards to each member
of the family by name, and tried to write
** Miss Paulton " like the rest of the letter,
but failed, so that it was the most ill-written

part of all. He had little hope of
Alfred's coming.

To his astonishment he got a reply-thanking
him for his kind invitation, and
saying that although Dr. Santley at first
thought the south of Europe would be
preferable, he had at length yielded to
Alfred's earnest importunities to be sent
to Ireland, where he could enjoy the
society of his friend Jerry, which he was
certain would tend more to his recovery
than anything else in the world.

*^ I am astonished," thought O'Brien,
"that he did not insist on going abroad,
if it was only for the chance of meeting
that siren who has bewitched him. There
is one thing plain from this — he has not
only got over his dangerous physical illness,
but that much more dangerous affection
of the heart from which he has been
suffering. What a madness that was ! I

hope and trust, for this sake, that woman
has married Blake by this time. But no —
I do not. That woukl be too bad a fate to
wish even to an enemy ; and surely she
has never done me harm."

O'Brien did not repeat his visit to the
*' Blue Anchor," but now and then he met
burly Jim Phelan, the boatman, and talked
to him about the Black Kock and the
Whale's Mouth.

For the first week O'Brien was at
Kilcash the weather had been singularly
calm. It had rained nearly every day;
nothing else was to be expected there at
that time of the year. But scarcely a
breath of wind touched the sea. The long
even rollers slid into the bay, and burst
upon the sands in front of the village.
They flung themselves wearily, carelessly
against the cliffs without the bay, and after
tossing their arms languidly a moment in

the air, fell back exhausted into their foamy
bed.

One morning, as O'Brien was walking on
the strand after breakfast, he met Jim
Phelan, and, as usual, got into talk with him.
After a few sentences of ordinary interest,
Jim said :

The other night, sir, at the ' Blue
Anchor,' you asked me a whole lot about
the Black Rock and the Whale's Mouth.
Did you ever see her spout ? "

No," answered O'Brien, looking at the
south-western region of the sky. "I have*
often been here, winter and summer, but I
have never been so fortunate. Do you
think there's going to be a gale ? "

Yes, sir ; there's going to be a heavy
gale from the southward and westward, and
it will be high water at about three. You
can see the scuds flying aloft already, and
I'm greatly mistaken if we haven't a whole

gale before a couple of Lours are over.
That won't give much time for the sea to
get up, but I am sure she'll spout 
before the top of high water. Anyway,
if she doesn't, I'm greatly mistaken.
Would you like to go over and see it,
sir?"

Yes, Jim. I have nothing particular todo
to-day, and I certainly should like to see
it."

Very good, sir. I have nothing particular
to do to-day either, and if you like Til
go over with you."

I should be very glad. When shall we
start ? "

Well, sir, if you are to see it you mayas
well be there at the beginning, so we'll
be off at once. Did you feel that ? "

*eyes."

A puff of warm wind touched the two
men, and then the air was still again.

*' Go on, then, sir, to the hotel and put
on your oilskins. I'll run and get mine,
and be back in a minute."

But I haven't foot oilskins ! " said

o

O'Brien, with a smile. '* Will a mackintosh
and gaiters do ? "

The boatman looked long and fixedly
into the south-west before he answered :

*' No, sir ; a mackintosh would not be
any use out there against what's coming.
This will be a whole gale, or I'm a Dutchman.
It's been brewing a long time, and
we're going to have it now, and no mistake. '
I'll get you a set of oilskins, and maybe if
you went up to the hotel and put your flask
in your pocket, it wouldn't be out of the
way by-and-by. I'll bring the oilskins upto
the hotel."

All right," said O'Brien ; and he set
o£f.

In less than half-an-hour he found himself

in a clumsy, ill-fitting set of oilskins a
size too bio. Jim had brou^ijlit a sou wester
also. He himself wore his own oilskins and
his sour-wester, and, so equipped, the two
set out for the Black Kock.

As they reached the high ground of the
downs, another gust of wind, stronger and
of longer duration than the former one,
struck them. Jim tied the strings of his
sour-wester under his chin, and O'Brien
followed his example.

'rit will be a sneezer," said the boatman,
shaking himself loose in his over-alls, as if
getting ready for action.

The sea was still unruffled. The two
puffs of wind which had come as the advance
guard of the storm had passed lightly and
daintily over the sleeping ocean. The long
clean-backed rollers swept slowly shoreward,
staggering a little here and there when they
passed over some sunken rock. Down in

the south-west the sky was leaden-coloured,
with long fangs of cloud stretching towards
the land and gradually stealing upward and
onward. An unnatural stillness filled the
air. No wild bird of any kind was to
be seen. The gulls had long ago sailed far
inland. There were few sea birds here but
gulls.

"We'll be there before the first puff,"
said Phelan, buttoning the lowest button of
his coat. " She hasn't spouted now since
a little after Christmas, In that southerly
gale we had then she spouted fine."
*did it come over the cliffs ? "
**No, sir — not quite up to the cliffs.
'Twas a southerly gale, you know; and it
takes a south-westerly gale to send it over
the cliffs. Ah, that was a stiffer squall than
the last ! It's coming on. Heaven help
the ship that makes this a lee shore for the
next twenty-four hours ! "

The prediction was verified, for a fierce
gust had caught O'Brien in front and
threatened to tear the strings out of his
sour-wester.

The two men turn and resume their way.
The torn skirts of the south-western pall of
cloud are now almost overheard. They are
hurrying on at a dizzy rate. Out far upon
the water under the lowering cloud a dulness
has crept. The great mirror of the
sea has been breathed upon and sullied by
the wind. In shore, the waves rise and fall
tranquilly.

The squalls now become frequent. Although
the solid mass of the water beneath
is still unchanged, when the gusts fiy across
the waves and strike the cliffs the foam is
blown upward, hissing, and bursts into
smoke against the crags. From under the
broadening cloud a faint whispering sound
comes, thin and shrill like a broadened
whisper of the wind in grass.

Do you think the storm will last so
long as twenty-four hours ? ''

"Impossible to say, sir. But I think
there's that much due to us. Turn your
back to it, sir."

They draw near the Black Kock. Each
man keeps his body bent to windward ready
to meet the next onslaught of the gale.
Now only a few seconds pass between each
gust. Each gust is stronger and longer
than the former one. When they are
within a few hundred yards of the rock,
when they can plainly see the outline of the
little bay in which it is wedged, the storm
bursts fully upon them. One blast strikes
them, and lasts a minute. They are obliged
to stand still, leaning against the gale.
A lull of a few seconds follows, and then
the broad, mighty torrent of the wind
bursts upon them in its uninterrupted
fury, and for a while it seems as if they

must be .swept away by its persistent,
tremendous force.

At length they turn round, and, holding
on their southwestern, gaze into the face
of the wind. The sea is now boiling,
churning, but not yet roused. Foam
spurts aloft, where, before, the dull blue
waters rose and fell unbroken. The spray
crawls further and further upward against
the red-brown cliffs. The roar and tumult
of the wind is pressing against them. The
roar and tumult of the waters have not
yet begun.

At that moment Phelan catches O'Brien
by the arm, and points towards the Black
Rock. The figure of a man is seen clearly
against the sky-line. It gradually sinks
from view. It is descending the path to the
Black Rock below.

Let us run," shouts Phelan. 'rit is
certain death if he goes down."

They run at the top of their speed in
their clumsy oilskins. They reach the cliff
directly over the fatal rock. They look
down, around, at one another. Both start
back with cries of surprise and horror.

No one is to be seen.

VOL. II.

THE MONSTER LET LOOSE.

Neither man spoke. Phelan's amazement
had bereft him of words. He knew
the place thoroughly. He had known and
feared it from his earliest years. To left
and right were perpendicular cliffs. In front
stretched the evil Black Rock. From where
they stood descended the pathway to the
table rock below. On the broken ground
around them was nothing taller than dwarf
bushes, which could not conceal a goat and
to reach which the sure-goodness of a goat
would have been needed. In his youth
Phelan had been as bold as any lad in the

village. But neither he nor any other lad
of the village had ever dared to tempt death
on those steep, friable, rotten slopes.

Beyond all doubt he had seen the figure
of a man disappear over this cliff a few
moments ago. Where was he — it — now ?
The Black Kock lay bare, naked, at their
feet. A man's head could not be hidden
there. Whither had that figure gone ? It
could not have reached the sea in the time.
The monster had not yet broken loose, and
the man could not have been swept into the
water. No shattered corpse lay on the
greasy rock beneath. A man cannot fly.
What had become of this man ? Or had
they seen a ghost?

He turned to O'Brien and noticed that
the latter looked pale and scared.

You saw him ? " he shouted above the
storm. " You saw him as plain as daylight
? "

"Yes''

What do you make of it ? "

I don't know."

Once more Phelan looked carefully
around him. Absolutely no trace of man
was to be seen. Except for their presence,
the place might have been alone since the
making of the world. He again turned
to O'Brien.

"Heaven be between us and all harm,
but it must have been a ghost ! "

"He could not have got to the Hole in
the time."

"Not if he had wings."

Did you ever see Fahey ? Of course
you did. You told me about him."

Merciful Lord, it was Fahey ! "

The two men looked mutely into each
other's faces. Anything like a regular
conversation was now impossible owing to
the force and noise of the storm.

O'Brien had had a theory. The events
of the last two minutes had shattered his

theory to atoms. The two policemen who
had seen Fahey jump into the Hole had not
been mistaken. It was no ghost they saw.
They had tracked their man as surely as
they had ever tracked any one on whom
they laid hands. He, being innocent, was
suspected of a crime ; or, rather, he had
innocently, in ignorance, committed a
criminal act, and being pursued and hard
pressed, had flung himself headlong into
that awful pit. Within a couple of weeks
or so, O'Hanlon had seen that same figure
in this place, and now he (O'Brien) had seen
such a figure, and Phelan had identified it.
This was monstrous. What came of all his
inquiries respecting the Whalers Mouth
and the accessibility of the cave ? Nothing
absolutely nothing. His theory was
childish. He was glad he had spoken of
it to no man.

What was to be his theory now ?

Phelan was stupefied, and stood staring

at the cliffs and the rock as if he expected
them to undergo some stupendous change,
display some more incomprehensible marvel.
O'Brien stood back a few paces from the
brink, and kept his eyes fixed on the horizon,
which had lowered and come nearer.

Suddenly Phelan stepped back to O'Brien,
and, putting his mouth close to the ear of
the other, shouted —

She blows ! "

O'Brien dropped his eyes to the Black
Rock.

From the Hole a thin wreath of sea smoke
rose, and, bent sharply by the gale, almost
touched the cliff. A booming, hollow sound,
like the flapping of distant thunder among
hills, weighed on the air, and then came a
shrill, loud hiss, as of falling water, and
again the wind was drenched in sea-smoke.

Phelan stretched out his hands towards
the Hole, and shouted —

Look I "

The word was scarcely uttered when the
ground shook, and from that Hole a solid
column of water sprang aloft with a shriek
that drowned the raging of the storm. It
rose fifty feet into the air, turned inward
towards the cliff, and then toppled and fell
with a mighty crash that again made the
gigantic bases of the immemorial cliffs
tremble to their lowest depths.

The monster had broken loose !

O'Brien started back. He had from childhood
heard of the awful Pulling Hole, but
had never seen it in action before. His first
feeling was that this could be no display of
ordinary power, but that the cliffs and rocks
were riven by some Titanic force never
exercised before. He felt certain that when
again he looked down he should see the
Black Rock shattered, disintegrated, annihilated.
What could withstand such a blow ?

The boatman drew him towards the edge
of the cliff once more. He was scarcely in

position when the huge shaft of water sprang
once more into the air, this time to twice its
former height. He was appalled, and again
sprang back. The gale caught the capital
of the column and lifted it bodily, dashing
it against the cliff. O'Brien was covered
from head to foot with water.

The two men shifted their position, so as
to get out of the reach of the water, and
then stood mutely looking at the terrible
phenomenon.

When O'Brien's alarm subsided, and he
knew by the conduct of his companion that
there was no occasion for fear, he stood
fascinated by the stupendous spectacle. He
had heard this described hundreds of times,
lout his imagination had not had space for
grandeur such as this. The Hole did not
spout at every wave, but took breathing
space like a living thing. Now he understood
why the opening of the cave was

called the Whale's Mouth. Now he understood
why the people said " she spouts "
when the Puffing Hole flung its hundreds of
tons of water a hundred feet into the air.
It was a daring fancy which saw in the
strange freak of nature a colossal representation
of the spouting of the whale. The
Black Rock was the head, the cave the jaws,
the shaft in the rock the blow-hole of a
whale multiplied a thousand times.

And he, presumptuous fool that he was,
had imagined a boat might enter that cave
and come out uninjured — that a man might
throw himself into that awful funnel and
survive !

In half an hour O'Brien and Phelan left
the edge of the cliff and turned their faces
towards the village. Notwithstanding the
oilskins, both were wet through, for the
spray and fine mist from the sea penetrated
at the neck, the wrists, and under the

buttons in front. They kept more inland
on their way back. Phelan was the first to
speak of the mysterious figure they had
seen. He had no difficulty in the matter.
They had seen the ghost of Fahey, who had
committed suicide there ten or eleven years
ago. Nothing could be simpler or more
natural than this explanation. It was a
horribly wicked thing to commit suicide,
but to throw one's self into the Puffing Hole
was a double crime ; for, in addition to
making away with life, it was defying
Providence — it was courting the most awful
death that could be sought by man. The
supernatural appearance that day was to bea
warning to O'Brien, who had displayed an
unwise curiosity as to the Puffing Hole and
the Whale's Nose. From the nature of
O'Brien's inquiries, it was, notwithstanding
his denials, almost certain that he had
formed a design of going in a boat up the

cavern. The spirit of the dead man had
been sent to show him the penalty of any-such
impious risking of life, and to remind
him of the fate he would surely encounter
if he dared to do anything so rash.

A NIGHT TRAVELLER

When O'Brien got back to the "Strand
Hotel" at Kilcash, he thought the whole
matter over for an hour or so. Then
he sat down and wrote a note :

"My dear O'Hanlon,

Jim Phelan, the boatman, and I
went to the Black Rock to-day to see the
Puffing Hole spout. When within a few
hundred yards of the cliff over the Rock,
we both plainly saw the figure of a man,
which Phelan declared to be Fahey's ! Are

you satisfied now ? I am not. I'll run into
Kilbarry tomorrow.

"Yours always,

"Jeremiah O'brien."

Then he ate his dinner, and went out
to pay another visit to the *' Blue Anchor."

By this time Jim Phelan had told the
story of that day's visit to the Black
Rock to many of the villagers, and although
the simple fisher folk as a rule
retired very early during the long nights,
most of them made an exception on this
occasion. Many of the men and women
sought neighbours' houses, and discussed
the mysterious appearance of the form of
Fahey hours after their usual time forgoing
to bed.

But Jim himself was not at any of
these domestic gatherings. He was the
hero of the hour, and the natural place

for a hero was the taproom of the 'blue
Anchor."

There was a feeling among the men of
Kilcash that no subject of prime importance
to the village could be discussed
anywhere else so well as in the taproom
of the "Blue Anchor." Ordinary events of
an ordinary day might be suited to the
shelter of the Storm Wall on the shoreward
face in a breeze or rain, or the rocks
beneath the wall when the weather was
fine. But neither of these, nor even the
bar of the "Blue Anchor" itself, accorded
with grave or exciting discourse of an
exceptional nature. The taproom was the
only place in which men could give unbridled
license to debate. Here one could
not only unbend, but give expression
to the most audacious theories without
danger of reproof or repression by wives
or mothers.

When O'Brien entered, a dozen men

were crowded into the dimly - lighted,
squalid room. As he had drawn near
the house he heard voices raised in eager
conversation. His entrance was the signal
for silence. This was partly owing to
his superior social position, and partly to
the fact that his name had mingled freely
in the talk for some time. He sat down,
called for beer for himself and those around
him, and lit a cigar. The storm was still
blowing so strongly that he had found it
impossible to smoke in the open air.

Jim Phelan was there, and the men'
were all seated as close as the rickety
benches would allow.

Well, men," said O'Brien, *' I dare say
I could guess what you were talking of.
Did any of you ever hear of anything
like it until now? — I mean, did any of
you ever hear that the ghost of this man
Fahey had been seen in the neighbourhood
before ? "

Several men answered in the negative ;
the others shook their heads.

O'Brien then rehearsed all he had
gathered from Phelan of Fahey, and asked
the others if they could add anything to
the tale.

At this they shook their heads also.
He then inquired if among them they
could find an explanation. But this produced
no better result. He felt baffled,
discouraged. He had not counted on
learning much, but he had expected to
gather something.

After a stay of some time he left the
Blue Anchor " with nothing added to his
store of facts or surmises. During the
time he had sat there and smoked his
cigar, he had heard much of what he
knew repeated over and over again, with
the wearying garrulity of those into whose
lives few events of varied interest enter.
The storm was raging still abroad, although

the violence of the wind had considerably
abated. The sky was now strewn with
shattered, rugged clouds, wreckage of the
gale. Here and there groups of pale stars
shone out in the dull sky. The night was
not dark. No moon shone, but a pale blue
radiance filled the clefts and chasms between
the clouds, and fringed their rugged edges
with hues of dull steel.

By this time the tide was falling. The
sea, even in the bay, had been lashed into
fury, and was breaking in sheets over the
Storm Wall, under the partial shelter of
which O'Brien walked towards the " Strand
Hotel."

He kept his head bent low, in order to
avoid the flying spray. On his right was
the Storm Wall, with the bay beyond. On
the left the village, with its few scattered
lights. Kilcash Bay made an irregular
shallow bow on the innermost side, and
along this bow from one end to the other

VOL. II. N

of it the village was built. As became a
house of such importance as the ** Blue
Anchor," it stood near the middle of the
bow, not on the main road, but on a little
narrow road running at right angles to the
Storm Wall, and on which were very few
houses. At the end of this by-road, and to
the right facing the sea, lay the cottages of
the village. These were owned chiefly by
fishermen, and were let to visitors in the
summer, while the families of the fishermen
retired to some other shelter, situate visitors
never knew exactly where. To the left
stood the more ambitious half of the village.
Here were the few shops and two-storey
houses it contained. At the further
end of this left-hand half stood the ^' Strand
Hotel," the most imposing-looking house in
the place, and the point towards which
Jerry O'Brien was now making his way in
the lee of the wave-beaten wall.

O'Brien did not look at his watch before

leaving the *' Blue Anchor," but he knew it
was about nine o'clock. At such an hour,
in such a season of the year, the village
was usually plunged in darkness, except
for the lights in the one hotel and the one
public-house. The few shops were never in
the winter open after seven, and not ten in a
hundred of the inhabitants were out of bed
at nine o'clock. But owing to the story
which Jim Phelan had brought back from
the downs that day, this was not considered
an ordinary night, and there were more
lights than usual twinkling in the houses
still.

But as O'Brien forged his way laboriously
forward, under the protection afforded by
the wall, he became aware that one of
the shops was not only open, but doing
business too, at this advanced hour of
night.

Between O'Brien and the shop were a
broad road and a little garden — for all the

N 2

houses and cottages, including those with
shops, had gardens in front.

O'Brien's mind was not busy at the moment,
and out of idleness, rather than
curiosity, he kept his eyes on the open
door of the shop as he drew near and passed
it.

Before he had gone beyond the point at
which he could command a view of it without
turning his head back inconveniently,
some one came out of the shop, the door
closed, and all was dark.

Here a severe gust of wind almost carried
off O'Brien's hat, and he paused a moment
to pull it down over his brows, and wait
until the spray of a wave, which had just
climbed the wall and sprung over it, fell on
the road in front. Partly to shield his face
from the wind, and partly out of a desire to
try and make out what kind of being had
the daring to come with custom to Migrate's
at such an unusual hour, he kept his face

turned inland, and looked at the figure
which had emerged from the shop. The
form was that of a man — a man of the average,
or perhaps slightly over the average
height — bulky, or, rather, bulged — no, not
bulky, but bulged — irregular — stooped,
stooped as though he carried a bundle, or
was very old, or was a hunchback. The
man was going on at a quick pace in the
direction of the hotel.

He can't be staying at the * Strand,' "
thought O'Brien. "I am the only visitor
at the * Strand.' And yet where can hebe
going ? No person living in the village
would dream of knocking up M'Grath at
such an hour except in a matter of life
and death, and M'Grath doesn't sell
drugs."

They were now getting near the end
of the houses. The " Strand " was the last
building in the village. The garden at
its rear climbed partly up the slope of

the downs. The nearest dwelling-place
beyond the hotel was Kilcash House, the
late Mr. Davenport's home. That house
stood a mile back from the cliff, and the
shortest line from it to the sea would
bring one to the Black Rock.

As O'Brien saw the man pass the last
house of the terrace and approach the
hotel, he watched no longer, but turned
his eyes out for one last look at the sea,
with the reflection, "There is nowhere
else for him but the * Strand ' — unless," he
thought, with a smile, "he is going to
visit our old friend Fahey at the Black
Rock. A nice quiet place to spend an
evening like this would be the Puffing
Hole."

He shuddered. Even here, two miles
away from it, and within a few yards
of his comfortable room, with lamps and
a fire, and absolute security from the sea,
it was not possible to think of that awful

Hole unmoved. Althoiigli the tide was
receding, it was higher than when he and
Jim Phelan had been at the Rock. The
water had then been flung up a hundred
feet into the air. Now, no doubt, it was
mounting a hundred and fifty feet — ay,
two hundred feet, in a solid, unbroken,
bent column ! What a hideous fate it
would be to stand down on that fatal
rock and, with the certainty of immediate
destruction, watch that dire column
mount up into the air ! Ugh ! It wasn't
a thing to think of just now. He had-had
enough of the sea and storm for one
day. He'd go in and turn up the lamps,
and fit himself into an easy-chair in front
of the fire, and mix a tumbler of punch
and smoke a cigar, and forget all about
the confounded sea, except that it was
out here foaming and fuming away, wholly
unable to get at him.

He looked towards the hotel. The man

who had come out of M'Grath^s ought
by this time to have got within its
hospitable walls. No one was to be seen
stirring near it.

Ah, as I thought ! '^ mused O'Brien
complaisantly. 'but what can they
have wanted from M'Grath's at the
Strand ' at this hour of the night ? And
now that I think of it, the whole male
force attached to the house in any
capacity consists of old Billy Coyne, the
stable man, and myself. I've not been in
M'Grath's buying things — that is, at least,
not with my knowledge and consent.
But then this is a queer place, where
queer things happen now and then."

He turned to cross the road, but was
again brought to a standstill by a fierce
gust of wind and dash of spray. While
he was holding on his hat, his face was
turned towards the pathway leading to
the downs high above. He shook the

spray off him, and was on the point of
moving away when his eyes caught something
moving upward and forward on
that path. What the object was he could
not determine, for the light was poor
and uncertain, and the distance considerable.
One moment he thought it was a
pony; the next it seemed to resemble a
human being. He stood still a minute
or two, long enough to make sure he
could not come to a conclusion, as the
thing continued to recede and the light
did not improve.

He shrugged his shoulders. The affair
was not of the least moment to him. He
crossed the road and entered the hotel.
He was in the act of taking off his overcoat
in the hall when he caught sight of
old Billy Coyne, who in the winter acted
as handy man about the place, and discharged
now and then the functions of
waiter and boots.

'who came in just now, Billy?" he
asked.

Sorrow a soul, sir," answered the old
man, helping O'Brien with the coat.

I mean, who was the man that came
out of M'Grath's carrying a bundle on his
back?"

*some one carrying a bundle on his
back?" queried the man in respectful perplexity.


'' Yes," said O'Brien, sharply.

He was annoyed at what he considered
the stupidity of Coyne.

"The yard door is locked this hour, and
no one could come in that way. Ever
since you went out, sir, I've been about
here ; and although the sea and the wind
are high, I am used to them, and no one
could, and no one did, come in. Nobody,"
added Coyne, emphatically, "crossed that
threshold" — pointing to the front doorway
" since you went out, sir, until you yourself

crossed it this minute. If you saw
anything " — mysteriously — " for goodness
sake don't say a word about it, or you 11
have the missus and Mary in dread of their
lives, if they don't die of the fright. Did
you see it come in ? "

O'Brien dropped his brows a little over
his eyes, and looked at the man. Coyne
did not seem as though he had been
"drinking or asleep.

*' Go and ask Mrs. Carey and Mary, and
when you are coming back, bring me some
whisky and hot water,"

When Coyne reappeared it was with the
full assurance that neither Mrs. Carey, the
landlady, nor Mary, the housemaid, had
seen or heard any one enter the house
between Jerry's leaving it and his return
just now.

What was Jerry to make of this ? There
was not the shadow of a doubt that a man
had come out of Migrate's with a bundle of

some kind on his back. He had watched
that man with a little curiosity until he
was quite sure he had no other cover to
go to but the hotel. Then came a time
when his attention was taken off the figure
and given to the sea. No man was to be
seen when he turned round, but something-was
going up the path to the downs. That
something must have been the man he had
seen leave Migrate's. Nothing could be
plainer than that. But who in the name
of all that was mysterious could think of
knocking at M'Grath's, and then ascend
the downs with a heavy bundle on such a
night ? There was no house for several
miles in the direction taken by the man
with the bundle except the residence of
the late Mr. Davenport, and that was two
miles off.

Fahey, or

Nonsense ! This rubbish about ghosts
was unworthy of a moment's consideration.

It was puerile, old-womanish, contemptible.
Besides, ghosts did not, as far as he knew,
knock up the proprietor of a general shop
and buy or any way carry away heavy
bundles on their backs. He must not
waste time with such rubbish again.

But what about Fahey ? Fahey was
more of a ghost than his own ghost.
Either Fahey was dead or he was not. To
jump into the Puffing Hole, was, everyone
said, certain death. Fahey had been
seen to jump into the Puffing Hole — seen
by two witnesses incapable of making a
mistake in the matter. The word of one
man in a case of this kind would be open to
doubt, but two men said they saw Fahey
jump into the Puffing Hole years ago.
That very day he (O'Brien) had seen a
figure which Jim Phelan recognised as
that of Fahey, and that figure had
vanished near the hideous caldron, but
without having time to get near it, and in

face of the fact that there was not another
means of accounting for its disappearance.

What on earth could he make of this ?
And now here was a mysterious figure
getting a shop opened at night, and in the
face of a fierce storm starting over the
downs in the direction of the Black Rock.

But the whole thing wasn't worth thinking
of What was it to him if Fahey'&
ghost were fictitious or real, or if Fahey
were alive or dead ? He'd put the whole
thing from him, and think of where exactly
he should build that house for Madge.

Next morning, before starting for
Kilbarry, he took a stroll and turned
into M'Grath's shop to buy a strap
for his rugs. They sold everything at
M'Grath's — twine, and candles, and bread,
and gunpowder, and kettles, and vinegar,
and calico, and tea, and butter, and sweetmeats,
and fishing-hooks, and hoops, and
wooden spades, and white lead, and garden

seeds, and flowers of sulphur, and dried
haddock, and camp-stools, and crockery-ware,
and pious pictures, and wall hooks,
and penny bugles, and cod-liver oil, and
bran, and a thousand other things — to
make a list of which would puzzle the
most experienced auctioneer or valuer.

*you had a late customer last night,"
said O'Brien, when he had selected the
strap .

Yes, sir. He came to buy a few
articles he wanted. He said that in my
father's time he often bought things in
this shop, and that as he was passing
through the village late he wanted to
see this place again for the sake of old
times."

'' How long is it since he was here,
did he say ? "

'thirty-seven years since he saw
Kilcash."

Then he is not young,"

Bless you, no, Mr. O'Brien ! He's
seventy-five, and with a bad cough too ;
and to think of him walking a night like
last night from this to Kilbarry, with
such a load too ! "

*' Seventy-five — seventy-five ! " muttered
Jerry. " That's no good."

"Ay, seventy-five, and looked everyday
of it. I don't think the poor fellow
is long for this world."

O'Brien left. A man of seventy-five
did not, he thought, bear much on the
case. The years were thirty or thirty-five
too many.

DULWICH AGAIN.

When Jerry O'Brien reached Kilbarry that
afternoon, he drove straight to O'Hanlon's
office, and briefly recounted to the astonished
solicitor what he and Jim Phelan had seen
at the Black Rock the day before. O'Hanlon
was for a few moments speechless with
amazement. When his amazement wore offa
little, he found himself bound in on all sides
with perplexities. He told himself a hundred
times that here was evidence enough to
satisfy the most sceptical of judges and
juries ; and yet he, a mere solicitor, could

VOL. II. o

not make up his mind to believe. O'Brien,
Phelan, and himself had seen something
they would swear was the figure of a man,
and Phelan and himself would swear that
what they had seen was in the likeness of
that Mike Fahey who had committed
suicide years ago by throwing himself into
the Puffing Hole while, in respect of a
groundless charge, pursued by the police.
It was distracting — it was incredible ; but
it must be believed.

He remembered when he was told at
school that if a penny had been put out at
five per cent, compound interest in the year
1 A.D., it would then equal in value a mass
of gold containing a globe as big as the
earth for every second of time since the
beginning of the Christian era. At first he
had said this astounding statement was not
true, but when it was plainly demonstrated
that it was even a ridiculous understatement,
he did not say it was not true, but

he could not believe it, although the figures
were irrefutable.

This history of the reappearance of Fahey,
or some shade or likeness of him, was now
above question. It stood on as firm a basis
as testimony could desire, and yet it was
naught to him but myth. Many of the
greatest truths are unbelievable. This was
a little truth, but in its integrity was impenetrable.


The one great consolation was that he,
O'Hanlon, need no longer fear his brain was
playing him false.

Like O'Brien, he came to the conclusion
that impossible ghost or still more impossible
man, the affair was none of his. He
wasn't going mad ; that was the great
thing.

That day the two friends chatted the
matter over while they sat before O'Hanlon's
fire after dinner, and they both agreed that
they would then and there say good-bye to

o2

Mr. Michael Fahey, whether he was matter
or spirit.

The solicitor had no more certain news of
the beastly Fishery Commissioners. They
were still hovering about the neighbourhood
; but no one alive, themselves included,
could tell what they were going todo,
or were not going to do, but they were
still deucedly hard on weirs. And — no ; it
would not be at all safe for Jerry to go to
London — just at present.

The two friends separated early, Jerry
going back to " The Munster." He had no
desire for a further time in Kilcash. Alfred
Paulton would be soon fit to travel, and
then once more he should go back to the
village ; but he now had business to watch
in Kilbarry. Certificates, and memorials,
and declarations, and so on, had to be obtained
or attended to, and although O'Hanlon
did all the business in connection with the
weirs and the Commissioners, both men

deemed Jerry's presence advisable. He
was extremely popular in the town, and
the request of a principal is always more
efficacious than that of an agent.

He had been only a few days at " The
Munster," when a letter put into his hand
one morning caused him an agreeable surprise.
The envelope bore the London postmark,
and the superscription, shaky though
it happened to be, was unmistakably in
the handwriting of Alfred himself.

Jerry broke the cover hastily, and read
the brief pencil note with pleasure, until he
came to the last two sentences — '* I do not
know where she is. They will not tell me
anything about her."

"Not cured, by Jove!" said Jerry to
himself, with disappointment. " One would
think his illness and relapse would have put
some sense into his head, or knocked some
nonsense out of it. But, after all, what is
there wrong in it ? Why shouldn't he fall

in love with whom he likes ? She is older
than he, and I am sure she would not marry
him, even if a sleepy Government would
only have the good sense and good taste to
hang Blake instead of worrying honest
folk about weirs and other things.
Alfred is the best fellow in the world.
Who could associate with Madge and not
be good — except, of course, myself? But
Alfred is dull ; there's no denying that.
He's more than a trifle mutton-headed.
Madge has all the brains of the family,
and the best heart, too, only she's going to
throw that away. Is she ? Wait till you
see, Madge. My darling ! "

He crooked his arm and held it out from
him, and looked at the sleeve of his coat
tenderly, as though a head rested there.

'Til spoil you with love when I get you.
Spoil you with love ! No woman ever yet
was spoiled with love. It's the flattery and
foolishness which spring from a desire to

win a woman any way, no matter how, so
long as you win, that spoil women. I'd
like to see a Fishery Commissioner spooning.
By Jove, it would be a fine thing if a fellow
had a sister a Commissioner was spooning !
First you could get him to allow you to do
anything you liked, and the moment he
turned crusty, you would only have to ask
your sister to poison him. I'm sorry I
haven't a sister. But, stay, I will have one
soon. Edith onus marry a Commissioner.
"When Madge and I are settled, I will ask
Edith to stay with us, and fill the house
from garret to basement with Commissioners.
(I wonder how many of the beasts there
are ?) But I must not say anything to
Madge about this scheme until we are
married. If I mentioned it now she might
object to the poison — there is no depending
on women, until they are married. But once
a woman is married you may count on her
for anything. Look at Lady Macbeth !

What a wife she was to have at a fellow's
elbow I Why, she wasn't merely a wife —
she was a spouse. What the difference is I
don't know ; but I'm sure she was a spouse
more than a wife — just as an awful father
or mother is a parent. But what is it I was
thinking of ? "

Jerry could be cool and collected and
coherent when he liked, but he did not like
it now.

Days passed by uneventfully with Jerry
at Kilbarry. He answered Alfred's letter,
but made no reference to Mrs. Davenport.
He thought it safer not. He was quite
sure neither Mr. nor Mrs. Paulton would
look with favour on their son taking a
continued interest in the widow. To him
there was something grotesque in Alfred
falling in love with a widow. Beyond
doubt Alfred was in love with this strange
and beautiful woman. Jerry did not

wonder at his young friend's enthusiasm.
He would have been a cold-blooded man
under thirty who could see her without
feeling profound admiration. But Alfred
would have to get over this infatuation. It
could never come to anything. Of course
time would cure him. Up to this, time
had apparently been losing its opportunity.
When a man is in love with the sister of a
friend, it makes matters pleasant if the
girl's brother is involved in a similar enterprise.
But Jerry would rather forego such
an advantage in his case than that matters
should become serious between Alfred and
the beautiful widow.

Daily Jerry saw O'Hanlon, and daily
urged upon him the desirability of despatch.
So importunate was the younger man, that
his friend and adviser at length became
suspicious and finally certain of the cause
from which Jerry's anxiety for haste

sprang. " When the weirs are out of
danger," said the solicitor, '* I know the
next job you'll give me to do."

What is it ? " said Jerry, colouring
slightly, and looking his companion defiantly
in the face.

A settlement — a settlement ! A
marriage settlement, I mean ! " — with a
wink.

"Don't be a fool, O'Hanlon. I wish
you'd get a settlement about the weirs."

At length the day came on which Jerry
set out for London for the purpose of
bringing over his friend for change of air
and scene. In two senses of the phrase,
the weirs were still where they had been
five weeks ago. One of these senses was
satisfactory : the weirs had not been pulled
down by the ruthless Commissioners. The
other sense was discouraging : the Commissioners
had not yet done with the
weirs, and the weirs were still in danger of

being pulled down, as engines wliicli obstructed
the free navigation of the river
Bawn. Notwithstanding this, Jerry made
the journey in the best of humours, and
having arrived without adventure or accident
at Euston, drove to his old lodgings
and renewed his acquaintance with the
civil landlady and the odious table-cover.
His first call next morning was at
Dulwich. He had not written to say
the hour at which he would reach Carling-ford
House, and when he arrived and asked
the servants after each member of the
family, he found they were all out with
the exception of the invalid. At first
this rather chilled Jerry, but upon a
moment's consideration he thought that
after all it was best Alfred and he should
have a few moments together alone. There
was no reason, as far as he knew, for
precautions of any kind ; but Alfred might
be excitable, and it was desirable that"

Mrs. Davenport's name should occur but
sparingly, or not at all.

He was shown into a little back drawing-room,
where he found Alfred sitting in
an easy-chair at the window. Alfred rose
with eager alacrity. The two friends held
one another by the hand for some time
in silence. Then Jerry spoke and thanked
heaven Alfred looked so well, quite well,
better than ever he had seen him before
thinner no doubt, but better. "Why,
you have got a colour like a bashful girl
in a little fix ! ''

I — I have just heard surprising news."

What is it ? " asked Jerry, looking
keenly at his friend.

First, tell me when are we to go to
Ireland — to Kilcash ? "

Whenever you like, my dearest Alfred'*

** But how soon ? " he asked eagerly.

Whenever you like, my dear boy, I
am at your disposal. But do not run

any risk — do not hasten away for my
sake."

Jerry was thinking of how little it would
cost him in the way of self-denial if he were
obliged to pass a month under this roof.

But will you hurry away for mine f "

For yours, my dear Alfred ! Of course
I'll do anything you wish. But how hurry
away for yours f "

Then we can start tomorrow for Kil-cash?"


'sto-morrow I Why, what's the matter,
Alfred?"

Ah, I know it is too late for to-day.
But tomorrow we set out for Kilcash.''

"If you wish it. But why this excitement
? It's the dullest place in the world."

Dull— dull ! Why, she's there by this
time ! "

Alio, in the name of mercy f "

"Mrs. Davenport."

ANOTHER VISITOR.

O'Brien was struck dumb. " Mrs. Davenport,"
he thought, in a dazed, unbelieving
way — " Mrs. Davenport at Kilcash ! It
can't be possible. There is some mistake."
Here was a complication on which he had
never counted — which it would have been
idle to anticipate. The position in which
he found himself was perplexing, absurd.
It was useless to hope any longer that
Alfred was not desperately in love with
this woman, who had recently been the
central figure in a most notorious and
unpleasant inquiry. Alfred had seen her

only a few times, and could not have exchanged
a word with her since that awful
night. It was absurd.

•'Mrs. Davenport," said Jerry, slowly,
^* had, I thought, gone away by this time.
How do you know she is in Ireland, or on
her way there ? Who told you ? "

Alfred smiled and sat down.

A friend found it out for me. She
did go to France for a week, but she came
back the day before yesterday, and is in
Ireland now. I am most anxious to see
her again. Poor woman ! — she must have
suffered horribly."

He had observed a look of anxiety, if not
disapproval, on Jerry's face, and tried to
make it seem as though he took no more
than a friendly interest in the widow.

"Alfred," said Jerry, slowly and seriously,
*' it won't do. I can see you are
hard hit."

** Nonsense !" cried Alfred, gaily.

Jerry directed the conversation far afield
from the subject to which Alfred would
willingly have confined it.

But Alfred was not to be baffled or
denied. The moment a pause occurred
he broke in with :

'jerry, you have not told me yet
whether we shall start for Ireland tomorrow
or not ? "

Alfred, have you ever been in love ? "

Never ! '^ — with a laugh, a slight
increase of colour, and a dull, dim kind
of pride in some feeling he had, he knew
not what — a feeling of comfort and exaltation.


"Because, you know, it's an awfully
stupid and miserable feeling. It's not
good enough to cry over or to curse
over. Sighing is despicable."

"How on earth do you know anything
about it, Jerry? I thought you were a
woman-hater."

'* Ay," said Jerry, vaguely. ''Do you
know of all people in the world whom
I should most like to be ? "

''No."

*one of Shakespeare's clowns. What
digestions these clowns had ! They are
the only perfect all-round men I know.
Mind you, they are no more fools than
they choose to be. If they pleased, they
could all be Chief Justices, or Archbishops,
or Fishery Commissioners, or
anything else fearfully intellectual they'
liked ; but they preferred to be clowns,
and kept their superb digestions, and
made jakes at lovers and such-like human
rubbish. Motley's the only wear."

"What on earth is the matter with
you, Jerry ? I never knew until now
that you had a leaning towards poetry T'
Alfred was gratified to find O'Brien thus
bordering on the sentimental. He would
have embraced with delight any chance of

VOL. II. P

breaking into the most extravagant sentimentality
himself. To think of O'Brien
countenancing sentiment was too delicious.
He added : "I don't know much about
Shakespeare ; but, for my part, I think
his fools are awful fools."
"Why, Alfred— why?"
'because they are so desperately wise."
Ay," said O'Brien, in a still more
desponding tone. '' A fool must be a
fool indeed when he chooses to be wise.

<' < Thy, then, brawling love ! loving hate !
any thing, of nothing first create !
heavy lightness ! — serious vanity !
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms !
Weather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health !
Still waking sleep, that is not what it is !
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh 1 ' "

No," answered Alfred : "I don't see
anything to laugh at. That seems a very
wise speech. Is it spoken by a fool ? "

i

''By an amateur fool, and a bad amateur
fool, too. It is one of the silliest
speeches in all Shakespeare. Whenever
Shakespeare wanted to have a little sneer
up his sleeve, and to his own self,
he put the thing in rhyming couplets.
Nearly all his rhyming couplets are jokes
for his own delight, and for the vexation
and contempt of all other men.
Shakespeare did penance for his sins in
his puns, and revenged his injuries on
mankind in his rhyming couplets. . . .
That's your mother's voice."

Yes," said Alfred, going to the door
and opening it, "that's my mother and
the girls. Come here, mother ; here's
Jerry O'Brien."

"Your mother and my girl," said Jerry,
down low in his heart. " 'Still-waking
sleep, that is not what it is.' Romeo is
the most contemptible figure in all history,
and Juliet the most adorable."

p2

Aloud he said at that moment : *' And
you, Miss Paulton — how are you ? "

Quite well, thank you."

"What a low blackguard," he thought,
Shakespeare was to kill Juliet ! But he
killed Romeo, too, and that may have
justified him in the eyes of heaven. Fd
forgive him even his rhyming couplets
if he'd only turn his tragic attention to
those accursed Commissioners. Just fancy
a lot of apoplectic fools, bursting, so to
speak, with the want of knowledge of
anything, and standing between that
darling and me ! May the maledictions

of " To Madge he said aloud, in

answer to her question : " Yes, I had a
very good passage across — not a ripple on
the water. You have never been across ? "

"No, never. I should very much like
to go," she said, as she sat down on a
chair, adjusted her mantle, and looked
up in his face.

"Oh, you ought to go over," he said;
^' the scenery is romantic."

He thought "romantic" might be too
strong for Mrs. Paulton, so he added
hastily :

"And the garden produce — owing," he
added, in explanation, "to the humidity
of the climate."

He felt rather foolish, and that he had
been saying very foolish things. But then
he didn't care. He did not want to shine
before her : she was the beacon of his
hope.

"Perhaps," she said, looking up, "father
might take us over next summer, or the
summer after."

She looked up in his face again. It
was desperately provoking.

Or the summer after," thought Jerry,
with a pang. " Does that girl sitting
there, three feet away from me, and who
doesn't think I care for her a bit, imagine

for a moment that I am p-oino: tolet her
wander about all the earth with that respectable
old gentleman, her father, till
the crack of doom ? Nonsense ! She
isn't a bit good-looking," he thought,
looking down into her eyes, and when
she lowered her eyes, gazing devoutly at
her hat — ** she isn't a bit good-looking —
not half as good-looking as Edith, and
Edith is no beauty. But still, I think,
rd feel excellently comfortable if the
others would go away, and I might put
my arm round her and try to persuade
her that she was happy because I did
so'

*you find Alfred almost quite well
again?" asked Mrs. Paulton genially of
Jerry.

"Oh, yes. He is almost as well as
ever, and of course will be better than
ever in a little while."

"A few whiffs of sea air will put me

on my legs once more," said Alfred, with
abounding cheerfulness. " I feel as if the
very look of the sea would set me all
right."

You unfortunate devil !" thought Jerry.
"Are you so bad as that? Oh, for the
mind of one of those plaguey clowns !
FalstafF was the only man who ever
enjoyed life thoroughly — FalstafF and
EafFaelle. What was the burden of flesh
carried by Falstaff compared to this
feather of lead ! ' What were all the
jealousies which surrounded Kaffaelle's
career compared to my jealousy of the
hat that touches her hair, or the glove
that touches her cheek ! "

"You will of course stay with us while
you are in London," said Mrs. Paulton.
"I told Alfred to be sure to say that
we insisted upon your doing so, and the
silly boy forgot it."

** Oh, he'll stay, mother," answered

Alfred. 'she'll stay with us while hein
London."

The invalid gave a glance at Jerry.
The latter understood it to be an
appeal for a very brief respite indeed
from travelling. Jerry was in no small
difficulty as to what he should say or
how he should act. He would like to
stop at Carlingford House a month, a
year. Even a month was out of the
question. But it was too bad that Alfred
should be in such a violent hurry to go
away. He believed Madge's brother had
no suspicion that Madge was particularly
dear to him. Still, common hospitality
would scarcely allow a man to hurry a
guest away from under his own roof after
twenty-four hours' stay, particularly when
that friend had come several hundred
miles to do his host a good turn. No,
hospitality would not allow a man to doit,
but love would. He, Jerry, could not

plead fatigue. That would be grotesque
in a healthy young man. He would not
lie and say he had business in London
which would keep him a few days there,
and yet it was shameful and ridiculous
that after a whole month of separation
he should be obliged to fly from her almost
before he had time to get accustomed
to the music of her voice. What delicious
music it did make in his hungry ears !
He would ask Alfred, without any explanation,
if the day after tomorrow
would not suit him quite as well as tomorrow.


He made a sign to Alfred, and the two
young men passed through the folding
doors into the front drawing-room. Here
a bright fire burned. Alfred went to the
fire — Jerry to the window. The latter
looked out, started, and said slowly :

"Alfred, there's a visitor coming up the
garden."

"All right," said Alfred without interest.

And it's a woman."

All right."

** And it's Mrs. Davenport."

What ! "

In a second Alfred was by Jerry's side.

Jerry laughed softly.

All right ? " he repeated in an interrogative
voice.

Alfred's face blazed, but he did not speak
or move.

"l HAVE BEEN ALWAYS ALONE."

Mrs. Davenport knocked at the front door,
and was shown into the back drawing-rooms
where the ladies were sitting.

I have come, Mrs. Paulton," she said,
*' to thank you and Mr. Paulton and your
family for the great kindness you showed
me in my trouble. I am afraid that at the
time I was too intent on my own misfortunes
to say as fully as I ought what
I should have felt. Indeed, to be quite
candid, I do not know exactly what I said
to you or your husband, or exactly how I
felt."

Mrs. Paulton went over to her, and
took the hand of the widow. O'Brien and
Paulton could hear and see everything
going on in the back drawing-room,
as they approached the folding-doors
slowly.

"My dear Mrs. Davenport," said Mrs.
Paulton gently, as she pressed the visitor's
hand, " you must not think of the matter.
We were, and are, deeply sorry for you,
and our only feeling in the matter was one
of regret at not having had an opportunity
of being more useful."

This was true now. Both William Paul-ton
and his wife were by the inquest perfectly
satisfied Mrs. Davenport had for a
while suffered from ugly suspicions because
a crazy old husband had made away with
his life in a perfectly mad manner, and
without being in the least induced to the act
by any fault of his wife. Every one agreed
with the jury that it had been a case of

suicide while suffering from temporary
insanity.

Another thing greatly helped Mrs.
Davenport into the good graces of the
Paultons. After Blake's release he stayed
in London, although Mrs. Davenport was
away in France. Since the trial young
Prince had kept Alfred informed on all
matters connected with the widow.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Paulton now felt as
though they had done an absolute wrong
to this woman, and Mrs. Paulton knew that
her husband would be delighted to show
her any civility or kindness he could. The
husband and wife were, as their son had
said, two of the kindest and most generous
people in England.

Alfred and Jerry entered the back room.
She held out her hand to the former, and
thanked him for what he had done. She
gave her hand to Jerry, and said, with a
wan smile :

TEMPEST-tossed,

*' I owe you an apology, Mr. O'Brien, for
my rudeness to you when last we met."

Rudeness ! Mrs. Davenport ! — your
rudeness to me ! I am shocked to hear you
say such a thing. I am shocked to think
you should have for a moment rested under
so unpleasant an idea. Believe me, you
were never anything but most polite and
considerate to me."

Madge admired this speech of Jerry's, for
it seemed to her very generous. She did
not greatly admire Mrs. Davenport. She
thought her too grand and cold and reserved.
But she did not go as far as Edith,
who positively disliked their visitor.

I am quite clear as to my bad conduct,"
insisted Mrs. Davenport, with her
wan smile. "When I met you in this
house the day after the — the dreadful
event, I did not speak to you, although
I recognised you instantly."

"But, Mrs. Davenport, you don't for

n moment imagine I did not realise how
terribly you were tried just then ? "

*' It is very good of you to make such
liberal allowances for my conduct, but I
fear I did not deserve your generosity ;
and 1 am more than afraid, if you knew
exactly how I felt, you would not be able
to forgive me so readily. I suppose it
was owing to the state of excitement I
was in at the time that the moment I
set eyes on you, Mr. O'Brien, I looked
upon you as an enemy."

An enemy — an enemy ! " cried Jerry,
in surprise and confusion. *what could
have put such a notion into your
mind?"

** I am sure I don't know," she answered,
shaking her head slowly. " I experienced
nothing but the greatest consideration
from you and every one else here. I
have since learned that I owe my introduction
to Mr. Prince to you — to you and

Mr. Paulton," she added, looking gratefully
at the young man.

Alfred coloured with delight and embarrassment.
To see and hear her wa
delight enough to outweigh all the troubles
he had yet known ; but to feel that her
voice and eyes were thanking and praising
him was intoxicating.

She was dressed in complete widow's
weeds. Her face was pale, placid, unwrinkled.
Her dark eyebrows, dark eyes and lashes,
and full red mouth afforded the only breaks
in colour. All the rest was pale, delicate
olive. The head had still the grand imperial
carriage, the eye the same unflinching,
haughty fearlessness. The full, red lips
met closely, readily, at the clear, curved
line, and parted easily, readily. Only hints
of the superlative graces of the figure came
through her heavy mantle. The hands lay
clasped in suppliant ease in the lap. Now
that she was free from commanding excitement,

her voice drew attention to itself.
The face and head, and the carriage and
pose of the head, were full of authority and
command ; the figure full of feminine
yielding gentleness. Now that the voice
was unburdened by heavy emotions, it partook
at one time of the nature of the head ;
at another of the nature of the figure. In
giving thanks to Mrs. Paulton, it was slow,
stately, gravely harmonious ; in confessing
her want of generosity to Jerry, it was low,
soft, full, intensely sympathetic.

Her words had taken O'Brien quite aback.
Was it divination, instinct, that told her he
had been friendly only in externals;, and
that he owed her no particular goodwill ?
Or was it that she did not at the time of the
fatal occurrence wish any one to be near
who knew much of her former life ? Could
it be that if he had been absent from the
inquest some of the unpleasant events preceding
her marriage would not have been

VOL. II. Q

SO nakedly exposed by either her or Blake ?
Who could tell ? Not he, certainly.

He looked from Mrs. Davenport to Alfred,
and mentally pitied him.

I cannot wonder," he thought, " at his
falling in love with her. If I were in his
shoes, I don't know what might happen tome.
Fortunately I am safe."

He glanced gratefully at Madge.

She could not understand exactly what he
meant by his eyes ; but she knew they were
not eyes of disapproval or dislike, and so
she looked down because she would have
liked to look up.

A general and desultory talk was going
on. Alfred felt quite well already. Notwithstanding
his feeble state, he felt the
strength of ten men against all the world.
He felt towards her a worshipful tenderness
he could not describe — did not want to
describe, only wanted to enjoy. When
one is sailing in the sun over a summer

bay, who wants to analyse the light, and
hear of the solar spectrum ? When one
is at the opera, who cares about the number
of vibrations it takes to produce a certain
note ? When one is in love, who cares
to analyse the charm ? Delight is not
so plentiful in the world that we need
pick it to pieces. Alfred would not try
to find out why he was supremely happy
in her presence. His happiness was enough
for him. Others might say what they.
pleased of her. All he would say was
"Let me be near her."

Of the two friends, O'Brien was the
more robust by far. His nature was
sturdy, almost aggressive. He had a
hatred of what he called "tinkering his
opinions." He could be as straightforward
and downright as any other man alive.
He could stick to his opinions, and had
a contempt for consequences. In manner
he was a trifle arrogant. It was this

Q 2

feeling of independence and self-assertion
which made him feel but slightly attracted
towards Mrs. Davenport, and which often
repelled him from her.

*'If she were my wife," he thought,
"there would be two masters in the
house, and it would end in my throwing
her out of a window — an act which would
no doubt import unpleasantness into our
household. And yet if she thought well
of wheedling me, she could. A man could
never be her husband. Davenport washer
owner. If ever she marries again,
it will be a master or a slave. Poor
Alfred would make a fine master for such
an Amazon ! But it's downright brutal
of me to call her an Amazon. After all,
it would be a very terrible thing to be loved
by that woman. I think if I were married
to her, I'd rather she hated me and
mastered me, always provided it was not
I who went through that window. When

you find yourself continually thinking of
a woman you are not in love with, ita
bad sign of the woman, as a rule."

Alfred had been of service to her —
service however slight — on the evening of
that terrible catastrophe. He had seen her
aimless, alone, helpless, dismayed. Her
voice that night struck the keynote of
the music she had awakened in his heart.
To those who did not know her well — to
those who had not seen her in difficulty
and despair, her outward seeming might
be one of command and victory. But he
had found her distracted with horror, had
lent her aid, and seen her relieved by his
own act. He had, in however humble a
way, played the part of protector. He had
seen the feminine, the dependant side of
her nature revealed. She might be stately,
commanding, self-sufficient, imperious to
others. To him she would always be the
yeoman who once leaned upon his manhood.

Her beauty, her grace, her commanding
stateliness might draw other admirers to
her side ; to him the child-like helplessness
of her womanhood lent the charm which
could never die or fade away, and brought
him more close to her heart than if he had
sat and worshipped at her feet for years.
He had been the donor of little in her
distress ; he would be the donor of all he
had or could command in the world for
her protection and peace.

While the ladies and the two young men
were chatting soberly together, Mr. Paulton
came in. He was unfeignedly delighted
to see Mrs. Davenport. He had never
been easy in his mind since that day she
left his roof in the depth of her misery.
Although she had gone away of her own
free will and of her own independent
initiative, he was unable to rid himself
of the feeling that he expelled this
woman from his roof when she most needed

friendship and protection. She had come
out of the ordeal of the trial purified, if
purification were necessary ; and public
opinion, of which he stood in great respect,
not only held him justified in the countenance
he had given her, but applauded him
loudly for his bold, open-handed help to
a lonely woman in a strange place.

And what are your plans for the
future ? " asked the old man in his most
solicitous voice. ''If I, or any of us, cap
be of the least service to you, I hope you
will command us."

She thanked him sadly, and said that
all which any one could do for her he
had already done. She had gone to France
for a short time to calm herself after the
late excitement, but she could not content
herself abroad.

"My life, Mr. Fault on, up to this, has
been tempest-tossed, although little may
have been seen of the disturbance. I am

weary of strife, and yearn for, quiet.
Kilcash is not a very lively place, but
it seems to me that 1 have within the
past couple of months had enough of excitement
to satisfy me for the rest of my
time."

He smiled, and shook his head in gallant
expostulation.

**No doubt," he said, ''a little rest in
your old home will be grateful and beneficial
to you ; but we must see you again.
"We have not so many friends that we can
afford to lose you."

I am a very new friend," she said
sadly.

Alfred would have given ten years of
his life to tell her she was dearer to them
than all the other friends they had in th
world. His father said :

*the depth of friendship is not to be
measured by years only, or, indeed, chiefly.
Some people have the faculty of making

better friends in an hour than others can
in a lifetime. We were brought together
under most peculiar and distressing circumstances,
and you have won all our love."
He took her hand with paternal cordiality.
"If we are so unfortunate as not to find
a little place in your heart, it must be
owing to some defect on our part — owing
to the want in us of some faculty which
could enlist your regard. It is not, I am
sure, my dear madam, from any lack of
desire to win your confidence and goodwill."


All this rather long and old-fashioned
speech was said with a sweet, benevolent
chivalry which would have silenced and
abashed any one who felt disposed to
regard it as too fine and elaborate for a
drawing-room scene of our own day.
Bravo, sir ! " cried Alfred. He was a
good, affectionate son, and had always
been on the best terms with his father ;.

but lie never felt absolutely proud .of the
old man before. He coloured with pleasure.
This simple homage of the old man touched
all — Mrs. Davenport herself — as something
sacred. The tears stood in his wife's eyes.
What a privilege it was to own the love
and share the confidences of such a
gentle and generous heart ! ''I am sure,"
said Mrs. Paulton, scarcely able to keep her
tears back, " that you will always think of
us as of old friends. I know you will makeup
out of your own goodness whatever you
may find wanting in us."

Mrs. Paulton took the widow's other
hand in both hers.

Mrs. Davenport opened her lips as if to
speak, but no words came. Then slowly
and mutely the tears formed in her eyes
and fell down upon her black dress. Alfred
and O'Brien withdrew into the front room
and closed the folding doors ; the two girls
stole noiselessly away.

Mr. Paulton moved to the window.
Mrs. Davenport's head gradually sank on
her chest ; she breathed heavily, and
swayed slightly to and fro. She rose
slowly.

'' I must go now," she said.

"No, no ; you must not. You must
stay with us. You are too lonely."

She looked fearfully into the other
woman's eyes.

'' I have been alone since I was born, aid
I am afraid."

'afraid of what?" asked Mrs. Paulton,
anxiously.

She thought the fear must have some
connection with the widow's recent trial.

"I am afraid of companionship."

Mrs. Paulton rose and stood before
her guest, gazing wonderingly into the
dark, fathomless, tearful eyes, now startled,
looking as though they expected to see a
strange, disturbing object.

"Come with me to my room." She
nodded towards her husband. "We shall
be quieter there."

"I cannot. I must get back. I am
going" — a shudder — "home this evening."

Mr. Paulton turned round and said :

"You shall not go to-night. You must
not leave us so soon. Go with my wife ;
she will comfort you. You have an hour
between this and luncheon."

The beautiful woman raised her face.

"Forgive me, Mr. Paulton. I have as
much hatred of anything like a scene as
any one else, but I feel — I feel a bit
broken — broken down. I am not so young
as I look. I am thirty-four ; but in all
my life I have lived alone, within myself,
and your kindness — the kindness of you
and Mrs. Paulton has been too much forme.
It may sound strange, but kindness is
unkindness to me. I shall be better when
I find myself alone once more. I am used

to such companionship — none other. Goodbye."


He went to her, and took her again
by the hand.

Hush, child — hush I I will not have
you leave us to-day. If we have been able
to do a little for you, do you a little for us.
Stay with us this one day, if no more — only
this one day."

**No, no; I cannot. Good-bye."

Wait ! " he said, holding up bis had
and approaching the folding doors that
opened into the front room. '^ It is a long
and lonely journey to the south of Ireland.
Perhaps we can find you an escort — company."
He passed into the front room.
The two young men were seated at the
window looking out on the little garden
between the house and the road. " You re
going to Ireland, to Kilcash, Alfred — when?"

We were thinking of going soon, sir ;
but "

He paused and looked at his friends
He knew his father well, and guessed
that he had asked the lonely woman to
stay with them for a while. His father
had indeed said more than once he wished
an opportunity of this kind might occur.

'' Can you go tomorrow ? Mrs. Davenport
wants to go to-night ; but if you
can manage to go tomorrow she may be
induced to stay to-night with us."

*ewe shall only be too happy, sir,"
said Alfred, turning away to hide his
satisfaction.

Very good. "We shall say tomorrow
evening," said the old man, as he withdrew
into the back room and shut the
doors. He went to where the two women
stood. " It is all settled. We will not
ask you to do too much for us this time.
Mr. O'Brien and my son are starting for
the south of Ireland tomorrow. They
are going to the village near which you

live — Kilcasli — and will leave you at your
own gate."

'•'Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Paulton goings
to Kilcasli ! Surely this is arranged forme
— at the moment."

No, indeed ; it has been settled for
weeks. You see " — he smiled, and imported
some gaiety into his voice — 'fate
is stronger than you. You would not
ask thei to set off at once — to-night ?
Mr. O'Brien arrived in London only lass;
night, and I could not dream of asking
him to start again for Ireland this evening.
Besides, Alfred, I am sure, could not get
ready in time, and you must not go alone.
Take her upstairs now, Kate, and make her
rest till luncheon. Take her away, Kate."

"But," she persisted, as Mrs. Paulton
guided her reluctant steps to the door, "I
am used to being alone."

'' Not travelling alone. I must have my
way this time."

"But I really am used to travelling
alone."

"Then we must insist upon this being
an exception. Now, we never allow any
arguments in this house."

He opened the door for the two ladies.
Mrs. Davenport shook her head mournfully,
and suffered herself to be led out of the
room by Mrs. Paulton.
